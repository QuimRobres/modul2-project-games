Step in and command your troops on the battlefields that defined History in the 20th century!\r\n<strong>Memoir '44</strong> is a historical game where players command a horde of little plastic Army men facing-off in dozens of WWII battles on an oversize hex game board.\r\nEach battle scenario mimics the historical terrain, troop placements and objectives of each army. Deploying forces through a variety of Command cards, the smart commander uses the unique skills of his units -- infantry, paratroopers, tanks, artillery, commandos and resistance fighters -- to its greatest strength.\r\nEasy to learn and fast-paced, Memoir '44 requires strategic card play, timely dice rolling and an aggressive, yet flexible battle plan to achieve victory!",

Deploying forces through a variety of Command cards, the smart commander uses the unique skills of his units -- infantry, paratroopers, tanks, artillery, commandos and resistance fighters -- to its greatest strength. \r\n Easy to learn and fast-paced, Memoir '44 requires strategic card play, timely dice rolling and an aggressive, yet flexible battle plan to achieve victory!

Horse-drawn broughams, hansoms, and dog-carts rattle over the cobblestone streets, pulling their passengers through the pea-soup fog.

Yet in the shadows and dark alleys of this great city, horrible and cunning crimes are committed daily, confounding the policemen of Scotland Yard. Still, even the most ingenious crime is only a puzzle for the world's only consulting detective—Sherlock Holmes!. "

      "description": "A game of Eclipse places you in control of vast interstellar civilizations, competing for success. You will explore new star systems, research technologies and build spaceships to wage war with. There are many potential paths to victory, so you need to plan your strategy according to the strengths and weaknesses of your species while paying attention to the other civilizations' endeavors. <br /><br />In the core of Eclipse, there are innovative resource management and action selection mechanisms. Even though you explore space and take over new sectors on the common game board, all the production and resource management is done conveniently on your own player board. The upkeep cost of your civilization rises rapidly as you take more actions and the area you control increases. This creates an interesting balancing problem and restrains the exponential growth of the civilizations.<br /><br />Eclipse is an epic empire building game that even with full player count can be played under three hours. Euro-type game mechanisms offer a smooth gameplay and minimize the downtime. Nevertheless, Eclipse has a lot of details and theme woven seamlessly into the game. For example, you may design your own starships: each player has four ship types that they can build and design as they will. The technology tree also has a new, non-linear system.<br /><br />Eclipse has seven different species for you to choose from. Each player can either play as Terrans (ie. humans) or one of the unique alien species. Each species has different characteristics and abilities. The modular board and the dynamic technology tree ensure that each session of Eclipse is unique!",

      "description": "<div>\r\n<div>\r\nOn the 11th of July, 1899 at 10 a.m., the Union Pacific Express has left Folsom, New Mexico, with 47 passengers on board. After a few minutes, gunfire and hurrying footsteps on the roof can be heard. Heavily armed bandits have come to rob honest citizens of their wallets and jewels. Will they succeed in stealing the suitcase holding the Nice Valley Coal Company's weekly pay, despite it having been placed under the supervision of Marshal Samuel Ford? Will these bandits hinder one another more than the Marshal since only the richest one of them can come out on top?\r\nIn <em><strong>Colt Express</strong></em>, you play a bandit robbing a train at the same time as other bandits, and your goal is to become the richest outlaw of the Old West. The game consists of five rounds, and each round has two phases:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Phase 1: Schemin'</strong> Each player plays 2-5 action cards on a common pile, with the cards being face up or face down depending on the type of the round. Instead of playing a card, a player can draw three cards from her deck.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Phase 2: Stealin'</strong> The action cards are carried out in the order they were played, with a player's best laid plans possibly not panning out due to mistakes and oversights!</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe game takes place in a 3D train in which the bandits can move from one car to another, run on the roof, punch the other bandits, shoot them, rob the passengers, or draw the Marshal out of position. The train has as many cars as the number of players, and each car is seeded with gems, bags of loot or suitcases at the start of play.\r\nEach player starts a round with six cards in hand, with each card showing one of these actions. At the start of a round, a round card is revealed, showing how many cards will be played; whether they'll be played face up or face down, or individually or in pairs; and what action will occur at the end of the round (e.g., all bandits on top of the train move to the engine). You can pick up loot, gems or suitcases only by playing a &quot;steal&quot; card when you're in a train car that holds one of these items — but since everyone is planning to get these goods, you'll need to move, punch and shoot to get others out of your way. You can punch someone only in the same car as you, and when you do, the other bandit drops one of the goods he's collected and is knocked into an adjacent car.\r\nEach player's character has a special power, such as starting the round with an extra card, playing your first card face down, or pocketing a bag of loot when you punch someone instead of letting it hit the ground.\r\nYou can shoot someone in an adjacent car or (if you're running on top of the train) anyone in sight, and when you do, you give that player one of your six bullet cards; that card gets shuffled in the opponent's deck, possibly giving her a dead card in hand on a future turn and forcing her to draw instead of playing something. If the Marshal ends up in the same car as you, likely due to other bandits luring him through the train, he'll be happy to give you a bullet, too.\r\nAt the end of the game, whoever fired the most bullets receives a $1,000 braggart bonus, and whoever bagged the richest haul wins!\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<strong><em>Nominated for the 2015 Spiel des Jahres award.</em></strong>",

      "description_preview": " \r\n \r\n On the 11th of July, 1899 at 10 a.m., the Union Pacific Express has left Folsom, New Mexico, with 47 passengers on board. After a few minutes, gunfire and hurrying footsteps on the roof can be heard. Heavily armed bandits have come to rob honest citizens of their wallets and jewels. Will they succeed in stealing the suitcase holding the Nice Valley Coal Company's weekly pay, despite it having been placed under the supervision of Marshal Samuel Ford? Will these bandits hinder one another more than the Marshal since only the richest one of them can come out on top? \r\n In   Colt Express  , you play a bandit robbing a train at the same time as other bandits, and your goal is to become the richest outlaw of the Old West. The game consists of five rounds, and each round has two phases: \r\n \r\n  Phase 1: Schemin'  Each player plays 2-5 action cards on a common pile, with the cards being face up or face down depending on the type of the round. Instead of playing a card, a player can draw three cards from her deck. \r\n  Phase 2: Stealin'  The action cards are carried out in the order they were played, with a player's best laid plans possibly not panning out due to mistakes and oversights! \r\n \r\n The game takes place in a 3D train in which the bandits can move from one car to another, run on the roof, punch the other bandits, shoot them, rob the passengers, or draw the Marshal out of position. The train has as many cars as the number of players, and each car is seeded with gems, bags of loot or suitcases at the start of play. \r\n Each player starts a round with six cards in hand, with each card showing one of these actions. At the start of a round, a round card is revealed, showing how many cards will be played; whether they'll be played face up or face down, or individually or in pairs; and what action will occur at the end of the round (e.g., all bandits on top of the train move to the engine). You can pick up loot, gems or suitcases only by playing a \"steal\" card when you're in a train car that holds one of these items — but since everyone is planning to get these goods, you'll need to move, punch and shoot to get others out of your way. You can punch someone only in the same car as you, and when you do, the other bandit drops one of the goods he's collected and is knocked into an adjacent car. \r\n Each player's character has a special power, such as starting the round with an extra card, playing your first card face down, or pocketing a bag of loot when you punch someone instead of letting it hit the ground. \r\n You can shoot someone in an adjacent car or (if you're running on top of the train) anyone in sight, and when you do, you give that player one of your six bullet cards; that card gets shuffled in the opponent's deck, possibly giving her a dead card in hand on a future turn and forcing her to draw instead of playing something. If the Marshal ends up in the same car as you, likely due to other bandits luring him through the train, he'll be happy to give you a bullet, too. \r\n At the end of the game, whoever fired the most bullets receives a $1,000 braggart bonus, and whoever bagged the richest haul wins! \r\n \r\n \r\n   Nominated for the 2015 Spiel des Jahres award.

But they were too cute to leave out so they're here! \r\n Place enclosures, animal houses, and shops skillfully in your park. Complete areas quickly to score a lot of points. Cover icons to get new tiles and park sections. Make the most interesting park for years to come! . "

      "description": "Build your own Path without your opponents steering you in the wrong direction-or off the board! Tsuro is the quick-playing game in which directions can change as easily as the game plays. The rules are simple: You place your stones, select your tiles, and attempt to build a safe Path for your journey. The Paths of other players cross and connect, so the choices you make affect all the journeys across the board. Stay on the right Path-your journey begins here.\r\nThe game consists of tiles with twisting lines on them, a 6x6 grid on which to lay these tiles and a token for each player. Each player has a hand of tiles. On your turn you do two things: place a tile from your hand onto the board next to your token and move your token as far as it can go along the line it is currently on, until it is stopped by an empty space with no tile in (yet), the edge of the board or colliding with another player's token. If your token reaches the edge of the board or collides with another player's token, you are out of the game. The aim of the game is to be the last player left with a token on the board. Strategy therefore consists of trying to drive your opponents either into each other or off the board whilst extending your own route in directions that will make it difficult for your opponents to do the same.",

      "description_preview": " Build your own Path without your opponents steering you in the wrong direction-or off the board! Tsuro is the quick-playing game in which directions can change as easily as the game plays. The rules are simple: You place your stones, select your tiles, and attempt to build a safe Path for your journey. The Paths of other players cross and connect, so the choices you make affect all the journeys across the board. Stay on the right Path-your journey begins here. \r\n The game consists of tiles with twisting lines on them, a 6x6 grid on which to lay these tiles and a token for each player. Each player has a hand of tiles. On your turn you do two things: place a tile from your hand onto the board next to your token and move your token as far as it can go along the line it is currently on, until it is stopped by an empty space with no tile in (yet), the edge of the board or colliding with another player's token. If your token reaches the edge of the board or collides with another player's token, you are out of the game. The aim of the game is to be the last player left with a token on the board. Strategy therefore consists of trying to drive your opponents either into each other or off the board whilst extending your own route in directions that will make it difficult for your opponents to do the same.

The breath is in our lungs,. The weak light in our eyes<br /><br />For generations, we have taken refuge in an ancient and haunted place, one whose first purpose was forgotten for a thousand ages, until our exodus once again filled its empty halls and hovels iwth our shadows. Here in the darkness, we seek a way back to the light.<br /><br />It has taken the breach mages an aeon to hone their dark craft, but they are ready, they are lethal. The breaches, the very conduits through which The Nameless travel, have become our weapon. The breach mages wield this power iwth undeniable ambition: to survive,to take back The World That Was, to protect our home.<br /><br /><em>Aeon's End</em> is a cooperative deck building game where your deck is never shuffled, a variable player order simulates the chaos of battle, and deck management makes all your decisions meaningful. Eveyry game you will face a different nemesis, each with a unique set of abilities requiring a different strategy to defeat.",

Us, Gravehold, and The Nameless - creatures seeking to snatch what little we left from our group. The breath is in our lungs,. The weak light in our eyes  For generations, we have taken refuge in an ancient and haunted place, one whose first purpose was forgotten for a thousand ages, until our exodus once again filled its empty halls and hovels iwth our shadows. Here in the darkness, we seek a way back to the light.  It has taken the breach mages an aeon to hone their dark craft, but they are ready, they are lethal. The breaches, the very conduits through which The Nameless travel, have become our weapon. The breach mages wield this power iwth undeniable ambition: to survive,to take back The World That Was, to protect our home.   Aeon's End  is a cooperative deck building game where your deck is never shuffled, a variable player order simulates the chaos of battle, and deck management makes all your decisions meaningful. Eveyry game you will face a different nemesis, each with a unique set of abilities requiring a different strategy to defeat. "

Carefully design your layout with walls, fountains, buildings and gardens. Use your money wisely and build the best gardens to win the favor of the Emir.<br /><br />Or do you purchase one of the available Palace pieces to expand your Alhambra? Be careful as you won't receive any change. However, if you can pay the exact amount, you will get another turn immediately!<br /><br />During the scoring rounds, you will receive Victory Points for having the majority of any type of palace piece. But that's not the only way to score points: the longer your City Wall, the more protected your Alhambra will be, earning you additional points.\r\nSpiel des Jahres (Game of the Year) 2003.",

Carefully design your layout with walls, fountains, buildings and gardens. Use your money wisely and build the best gardens to win the favor of the Emir.  Or do you purchase one of the available Palace pieces to expand your Alhambra? Be careful as you won't receive any change. However, if you can pay the exact amount, you will get another turn immediately!  During the scoring rounds, you will receive Victory Points for having the majority of any type of palace piece. But that's not the only way to score points: the longer your City Wall, the more protected your Alhambra will be, earning you additional points. \r\n Spiel des Jahres (Game of the Year) 2003. "

      "description": "<div>\r\nIn the faraway land of Ethnos, a new Age Is dawning. The ashes of the old Age have left the Six Kingdoms empty and the twelve Tribes scattered to the winds. Now is the time for a clever leader to unite them into a powerful alliance, skillfully using the unique talents of each tribe to control the Kingdoms.\r\nDo you have the wit and the wisdom to become the next Lord of <em>Ethnos</em> and usher in a Golden Age? Up to six players can evoke the assistance of the Tribes of <em>Ethnos</em> to earn themselves enough glory to be named the Lord of <em>Ethnos</em>. Find out if you're up to the task!<br /><br /><strong>The Tribes of <em>Ethnos</em></strong><br /><br />There are twelve distinct tribes that inhabit the land of <em>Ethnos</em>, and each has their own unique ability that will help you take control of the Kingdoms and gain glory for yourself. Call on the Centaurs when swift and decisive actions must be taken! Overwhelm your opponents with sheer numbers by relying on the Halflings! The Dwarves, Elves, Giants, Merfolk, Minotaurs, Orcs, Skeletons, Trolls, Wingfolk, and Wizards are all at your disposal!<br />Use the special abilities of each tribe to your advantage to take control of territories and gain yourself some extra glory along the way. Work with what you're given to spread your influence and unite the tribes of <em>Ethnos</em> to be crowned the victor!<br /><br /><strong>Beginning a New Age</strong><br />A game of <em>Ethnos</em> is divided into three Ages in which players will try to gain as much glory as possible. On their turn, players will choose to Recruit an Ally (from either the deck or the face up options on the table) or Play a Band of Allies. Recruiting allies to your cause is necessary if you want to gain any influence in the Six Kingdoms, which you do by playing Bands.<br /><br /><strong>Band Together<br /></strong> When you play a Band of Allies from your hand (from 1 to 10 cards), each ally within the band must belong to the same Tribe or the same Kingdom (color). Each band has a leader which will determine the ability you get to resolve when playing the band. If the band is large enough, you may place one of your control markers in that kingdom that matches the color of your leader card. You then use your leader card's ability. Then you must discard the cards remaining in your hand face up for other players to recruit from. These bands will be important for scoring at the end of the round, so leave them in front of you.<br /><br /><strong>Control the Kingdoms<br /></strong> As you gain more influence in a Kingdom, the bigger your bands must be to place your control markers there. Each Kingdom will reward players with an amount of glory at the end of an Age according to who has the most influence in each Kingdom. As Ages pass, the players with the second-most and third-most influence in each Kingdom will also gain glory.<br /><br /><strong> A New Age Dawns<br /></strong> The game will play out over three Ages, and the heralding of a new Age is brought on by the arrival of three dragons. Once the third dragon has been drawn from the deck, the Age ends and scoring for that Age begins. Control markers persist between Ages, representing the influence gained in Ages past. Once this has happened three times, the game is over and final scores can be tallied!</div>",

      "description_preview": " \r\n In the faraway land of Ethnos, a new Age Is dawning. The ashes of the old Age have left the Six Kingdoms empty and the twelve Tribes scattered to the winds. Now is the time for a clever leader to unite them into a powerful alliance, skillfully using the unique talents of each tribe to control the Kingdoms. \r\nDo you have the wit and the wisdom to become the next Lord of  Ethnos  and usher in a Golden Age? Up to six players can evoke the assistance of the Tribes of  Ethnos  to earn themselves enough glory to be named the Lord of  Ethnos . Find out if you're up to the task!   The Tribes of  Ethnos    There are twelve distinct tribes that inhabit the land of  Ethnos , and each has their own unique ability that will help you take control of the Kingdoms and gain glory for yourself. Call on the Centaurs when swift and decisive actions must be taken! Overwhelm your opponents with sheer numbers by relying on the Halflings! The Dwarves, Elves, Giants, Merfolk, Minotaurs, Orcs, Skeletons, Trolls, Wingfolk, and Wizards are all at your disposal! Use the special abilities of each tribe to your advantage to take control of territories and gain yourself some extra glory along the way. Work with what you're given to spread your influence and unite the tribes of  Ethnos  to be crowned the victor!   Beginning a New Age  A game of  Ethnos  is divided into three Ages in which players will try to gain as much glory as possible. On their turn, players will choose to Recruit an Ally (from either the deck or the face up options on the table) or Play a Band of Allies. Recruiting allies to your cause is necessary if you want to gain any influence in the Six Kingdoms, which you do by playing Bands.   Band Together   When you play a Band of Allies from your hand (from 1 to 10 cards), each ally within the band must belong to the same Tribe or the same Kingdom (color). Each band has a leader which will determine the ability you get to resolve when playing the band. If the band is large enough, you may place one of your control markers in that kingdom that matches the color of your leader card. You then use your leader card's ability. Then you must discard the cards remaining in your hand face up for other players to recruit from. These bands will be important for scoring at the end of the round, so leave them in front of you.   Control the Kingdoms   As you gain more influence in a Kingdom, the bigger your bands must be to place your control markers there. Each Kingdom will reward players with an amount of glory at the end of an Age according to who has the most influence in each Kingdom. As Ages pass, the players with the second-most and third-most influence in each Kingdom will also gain glory.    A New Age Dawns   The game will play out over three Ages, and the heralding of a new Age is brought on by the arrival of three dragons. Once the third dragon has been drawn from the deck, the Age ends and scoring for that Age begins. Control markers persist between Ages, representing the influence gained in Ages past. Once this has happened three times, the game is over and final scores can be tallied! "

      "description": "Preserved in its original form first published by Fantasy Flight Games in 2002, fans will find the same fantastic art from Jean-Louis Mourier and beloved gameplay that inspired the revised edition of the new and expanded Citadels. <br /><br />In Citadels Classic, the same inspired and simple gameplay remains, with players attempting to build a fantastical medieval city by constructing different districts. Each round, starting with whoever holds the crown, players will pass around a hand of characters equal to one plus the number of players, secretly choosing one character to employ, taking advantage of their special ability. Among the eight characters you might find, each boasts a different special ability: the Thief can steal all the gold from another player, the King grants gold for each Noble district you have constructed and receives the crown for the next round, and the Architect allows a player to build several districts that turn. <br /><br />After all players have chosen their character, they are revealed in the order determined by their rank, which is the number printed in the upper lefthand corner of their card. For example, if a player chose the Assassin with its rank of 1, they would resolve their turn first. The next to follow is the Thief with its rank of 2, then the Magician at 3, and so on, skipping characters that were not employed this round, and until all players have resolved their actions.<br /><br />When you do resolve your turn, you will choose to either take two gold coins from the bank or draw new district cards. Then, if you can afford to pay its cost, you may construct a single district from you hand. You may also resolve your character abilities as they apply during your turn, whether it be naming a character to kill with the Assassin or gaining extra gold with the Trader. Play continues until all players have resolved their actions, then the character cards are reshuffled and a new round begins.<br /><br />The first player to construct seven districts triggers the endgame, allowing the round to finish and all other players to take their final actions. Each district is worth its cost in victory points, with bonus points awarded for those who construct all seven of their districts and those who have at least one type of each district (noble, religious, trade, military, and unique). Whoever has the most victory points has built the most fabulous city and is crowned winner!",

      "description_preview": " Preserved in its original form first published by Fantasy Flight Games in 2002, fans will find the same fantastic art from Jean-Louis Mourier and beloved gameplay that inspired the revised edition of the new and expanded Citadels.   In Citadels Classic, the same inspired and simple gameplay remains, with players attempting to build a fantastical medieval city by constructing different districts. Each round, starting with whoever holds the crown, players will pass around a hand of characters equal to one plus the number of players, secretly choosing one character to employ, taking advantage of their special ability. Among the eight characters you might find, each boasts a different special ability: the Thief can steal all the gold from another player, the King grants gold for each Noble district you have constructed and receives the crown for the next round, and the Architect allows a player to build several districts that turn.   After all players have chosen their character, they are revealed in the order determined by their rank, which is the number printed in the upper lefthand corner of their card. For example, if a player chose the Assassin with its rank of 1, they would resolve their turn first. The next to follow is the Thief with its rank of 2, then the Magician at 3, and so on, skipping characters that were not employed this round, and until all players have resolved their actions.  When you do resolve your turn, you will choose to either take two gold coins from the bank or draw new district cards. Then, if you can afford to pay its cost, you may construct a single district from you hand. You may also resolve your character abilities as they apply during your turn, whether it be naming a character to kill with the Assassin or gaining extra gold with the Trader. Play continues until all players have resolved their actions, then the character cards are reshuffled and a new round begins.  The first player to construct seven districts triggers the endgame, allowing the round to finish and all other players to take their final actions. Each district is worth its cost in victory points, with bonus points awarded for those who construct all seven of their districts and those who have at least one type of each district (noble, religious, trade, military, and unique). Whoever has the most victory points has built the most fabulous city and is crowned winner! "

Artists, politicians, nobles, citizens, and tourists populated the streets of the city, and the emperor ruled them all.   \r\n You are in the thick of the Viennese Modern Age, trying your luck as a hotelier. For that, you must expand your little hotel and prepare new rooms. In the meantime, your guests require culinary excellence. Make sure each and every guest receives a proper dish and drink. You may need to hire additional staff.   \r\n Despite all that, do not forget to render homage to the emperor, or you will fall into disgrace pretty soon. Face the challenge and turn your little hostel into the Grand Austria Hotel! "

There is one thing you must not forget, however: Time will not stop for anyone and with time people will vanish. Those who will find themselves immortalized in the village chronicles will bring honor to their family and be one step closer to victory. A clever action mechanism is responsible for keeping turns short yet tactically rich and full of difficult decisions. Also unique is the way this game deals with the delicate subject of death; as a natural and perpetual part of life in the village, it keeps you focused on smart time-management.",

There is one thing you must not forget, however: Time will not stop for anyone and with time people will vanish. Those who will find themselves immortalized in the village chronicles will bring honor to their family and be one step closer to victory. A clever action mechanism is responsible for keeping turns short yet tactically rich and full of difficult decisions. Also unique is the way this game deals with the delicate subject of death; as a natural and perpetual part of life in the village, it keeps you focused on smart time-management. "

Your only option if you're to resume your dungeon-delving activities is to sack the local mall of valuables and supplies.<br /><br />Magic Maze is a real-time, co-operative game. Each player can control any of the 4 Hero pawns whenever he wants in order to make that hero perform a very specific action, to which other players do not have access: move north, explore a new area, ride an escalator? all of this requires rigorous co-operation between the players in order to succeed at moving the heroes wisely, and complete your mission before the sand timer runs out.<br /><br />Moreover, you will only be allowed to communicate for short periods during the game. The rest of the time, you must play without giving any visual or audio cues to each other.",

Your only option if you're to resume your dungeon-delving activities is to sack the local mall of valuables and supplies.  Magic Maze is a real-time, co-operative game. Each player can control any of the 4 Hero pawns whenever he wants in order to make that hero perform a very specific action, to which other players do not have access: move north, explore a new area, ride an escalator? all of this requires rigorous co-operation between the players in order to succeed at moving the heroes wisely, and complete your mission before the sand timer runs out.  Moreover, you will only be allowed to communicate for short periods during the game. The rest of the time, you must play without giving any visual or audio cues to each other. "

      "description": "In <strong>El Grande</strong>, players take on the roles of Grandes in medieval Spain. The king's power is flagging, and these powerful lords are vying for control of the various regions. To that end, you draft caballeros (knights in the form of colored cubes) into your court and subsequently move them onto the board to help seize control of regions. After every third round, the regions are scored, and after the ninth round, the player with the most points is the winner.\r\nIn each of the nine rounds, you select one of your 13 power cards to determine turn order as well as the number of caballeros you get to move from the provinces (general supply) into your court (personal supply).\r\nA turn then consists of selecting one of five action cards which allow variations to the rules and additional scoring opportunities in addition to determining how many caballeros to move from your court to one or more of the regions on the board (or into the castillo - a secretive tower). Normally, you may only place your caballeros into regions adjacent to the one containing the king pawn. The one hard and fast rule in El Grande is that nothing may move into or out of the king's region. One of the five action cards that is always available each round allows you to move the king to a new region. The other four action cards varying from round to round.\r\nThe goal is to have a caballero majority in as many regions (and the castillo) as possible during a scoring round. Following the scoring of the castillo, you place any cubes you had stashed there into the region you had secretly indicated on your region dial. Each region is then scored individually according to a table printed in that region. Two-point bonuses are awarded for having sole majority in the region containing your Grande (large cube) and in the region containing the king.",

      "description_preview": " In  El Grande , players take on the roles of Grandes in medieval Spain. The king's power is flagging, and these powerful lords are vying for control of the various regions. To that end, you draft caballeros (knights in the form of colored cubes) into your court and subsequently move them onto the board to help seize control of regions. After every third round, the regions are scored, and after the ninth round, the player with the most points is the winner. \r\n In each of the nine rounds, you select one of your 13 power cards to determine turn order as well as the number of caballeros you get to move from the provinces (general supply) into your court (personal supply). \r\n A turn then consists of selecting one of five action cards which allow variations to the rules and additional scoring opportunities in addition to determining how many caballeros to move from your court to one or more of the regions on the board (or into the castillo - a secretive tower). Normally, you may only place your caballeros into regions adjacent to the one containing the king pawn. The one hard and fast rule in El Grande is that nothing may move into or out of the king's region. One of the five action cards that is always available each round allows you to move the king to a new region. The other four action cards varying from round to round. \r\n The goal is to have a caballero majority in as many regions (and the castillo) as possible during a scoring round. Following the scoring of the castillo, you place any cubes you had stashed there into the region you had secretly indicated on your region dial. Each region is then scored individually according to a table printed in that region. Two-point bonuses are awarded for having sole majority in the region containing your Grande (large cube) and in the region containing the king. "

      "description": "<em><strong>Nemesis</strong></em> is a 1-5 player survival sci-fi game where players are woken up from hibernation as a crew of a space ship. The emergency procedure states that there is a critical system failure and the space ship can't continue its cruise. The goal of the crew is to find what is causing this failure and fix the situation to safely return back to Earth. The main problem is that one crew member is dead. Somebody crashed his hibernation chamber and pulled his body out. In addition, if you listen closely, some additional noises and sounds can be heard. New ones, strange ones, ones that were never heard before…\r\n<em><strong>Nemesis</strong></em> is a cooperation game combined with bluffing, backstabbing, and other elements of a science-fiction survival horror adventure.",

The emergency procedure states that there is a critical system failure and the space ship can't continue its cruise. The goal of the crew is to find what is causing this failure and fix the situation to safely return back to Earth. The main problem is that one crew member is dead. Somebody crashed his hibernation chamber and pulled his body out. In addition, if you listen closely, some additional noises and sounds can be heard. New ones, strange ones, ones that were never heard before… \r\n   Nemesis   is a cooperation game combined with bluffing, backstabbing, and other elements of a science-fiction survival horror adventure.

Reading the dynamics of the race and having a good sense of timing is just as important when it comes to backing the right camels and taking the victory.

      "description": "<strong>2nd Edition, 3rd Printing</strong><br /><br />90,000 B.C. - A great Ice Age is fast approaching. Another titanic struggle for global supremacy has unwittingly commenced between the varying animal species.<br /><br />Dominant Species is a game for 2 to 6 players that abstractly recreates a tiny portion of ancient history: the ponderous encroachment of an Ice Age and what that entails for the living creatures trying to adapt to the slowly-changing Earth.<br />Each player will assume the role of one of six major Animal groups-Mammal, Reptile, Bird, Amphibian, Arachnid or Insect. Each begins the game in a state of natural balance with regards to one another. But that won't last: It is indeed ''survival of the fittest.''<br /><br />Through wily Action Pawn placement, players will strive to become Dominant on as many different Terrain tiles as possible in order to draw beneficial Dominance Cards. Players will also want to propagate their individual Species in order to earn Victory Points for his particular Animal. Players will be aided in these endeavors via Growth, Migration and Domination actions, among others.<br /><br />All of this eventually leads to the end game - the final ascent of the Ice Age - where the player with the most Victory Points will have his Animal crowned the Dominant Species.<br /><br />But somebody better become dominant quickly, because it's getting mighty cold....",

      "description_preview": "  2nd Edition, 3rd Printing   90,000 B.C. - A great Ice Age is fast approaching. Another titanic struggle for global supremacy has unwittingly commenced between the varying animal species.  Dominant Species is a game for 2 to 6 players that abstractly recreates a tiny portion of ancient history: the ponderous encroachment of an Ice Age and what that entails for the living creatures trying to adapt to the slowly-changing Earth. Each player will assume the role of one of six major Animal groups-Mammal, Reptile, Bird, Amphibian, Arachnid or Insect. Each begins the game in a state of natural balance with regards to one another. But that won't last: It is indeed ''survival of the fittest.''  Through wily Action Pawn placement, players will strive to become Dominant on as many different Terrain tiles as possible in order to draw beneficial Dominance Cards. Players will also want to propagate their individual Species in order to earn Victory Points for his particular Animal. Players will be aided in these endeavors via Growth, Migration and Domination actions, among others.  All of this eventually leads to the end game - the final ascent of the Ice Age - where the player with the most Victory Points will have his Animal crowned the Dominant Species.  But somebody better become dominant quickly, because it's getting mighty cold.... "

      "description": "Walk a mile in the shoes of a spy! Or was it a kilometer in clogs?<br /><br />SPYFALL is an easy-to-learn card game of bluffing, probing questions, clever answers, and suspicion. At the start of each round, players receive a secret card letting them know where they are - a casino, space station, pirate ship, circus, (30 unique locations!) - except that one player receives the SPY card instead of the location. The Spy doesn't know where he is, but wins the round if he can figure it out before he blows his cover!<br /><br />Players then start asking each other questions during the intense 8-minute rounds. Non-Spy players want to ask questions and give answers that prove to the other players that they know where they are. But watch out! If your questions and answers are too specific, the Spy will easily guess the location and win, so you need to practice a bit of subtlety. But if your questions and answers are too generic, you might be accused of being the Spy. The Spy will also sometimes be asked questions (just like any other player would) and have to come up with questions of his own, without knowing anything about where he is! If you listened carefully to the other players, you'll be able to come up with a plausible question or answer... hopefully.<br /><br />Once per round, each player may accuse another player of being the Spy. If all players agree, the game ends and that player's secret card is flipped up. If the Spy is captured, each of the Non-Spy players win the round. If a Non-Spy is revealed, the Spy wins. Finally, if the Spy figures out where he is, he can reveal his card and make a guess. If he's right, he wins the round. If not, the Non-Spy players win.<br /><br />The game is played over a series of rounds and points are awarded each round. A complete game is typically five rounds and the cards are randomly dealt each round. You could even be the Spy two rounds in a row! After the last round, the player with the most points is the winner.",

Its innovative, easy-to-learn, cooperative gameplay has players working together against the monsters with varying levels of difficulty. Just as each monster is unique, they require different strategies and tactics to be defeated. "

      "description": "Set in ancient Rome, Trajan is a development game in which players try to increase their influence and power in various areas of Roman life such as political influence, trading, military dominion and other important parts of Roman culture. In Trajan, a player has six possible actions: building, trading, taking tiles from the Forum, using the military, influencing the Senate, and placing Trajan tiles on his tableau. At the start of the game, each player has two differently colored pieces in each of the six sections (bowls) of his tableau. On a turn, the player picks up all the pieces in one bowl and distributes them one-by-one in bowls in a clockwise order. Wherever the final piece is placed, the player takes the action associated with that bowl. Acquire victory points (VPs) in whatever ways are available to you - and since this is a Feld design, you try to avoid being punished, too. At the Forum you try to anticipate the demands of the public. In the Senate you acquire influence which translates into votes on VP-related laws. With the military, you take control of regions in Europe, earning more points for those regions.",

      "description": "Your time at Horribilorum Sorcery Academy for Witty Witches and Wizards is coming to an end, and that means final exams are here! You and your fellow students must compete to brew the most difficult and valuable potions around in order to be crowned Student of the Year in Potion Explosion.<br /><br />In Potion Explosion players attempt to create potions by pulling colored marbles from a dispenser and matching them with the needed ingredients for the potions on the table in front of them. While basic turns are simple, clever players will strategically pull colored marbles that both fulfill a needed ingredient and cause matching colored marbles to stack up in a single column, allowing them to collect all the like colored marbles and save them for later turns.<br /><br />Potion Explosion's simple rules make it easy enough for the whole family to learn, but offers enough depth to keep puzzle game fans coming back for more.",

You and your fellow students must compete to brew the most difficult and valuable potions around in order to be crowned Student of the Year in Potion Explosion.  In Potion Explosion players attempt to create potions by pulling colored marbles from a dispenser and matching them with the needed ingredients for the potions on the table in front of them. While basic turns are simple, clever players will strategically pull colored marbles that both fulfill a needed ingredient and cause matching colored marbles to stack up in a single column, allowing them to collect all the like colored marbles and save them for later turns.  Potion Explosion's simple rules make it easy enough for the whole family to learn, but offers enough depth to keep puzzle game fans coming back for more. "

      "description": "<em><strong>The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game</strong></em> is a cooperative adventure game in which the players attempt to complete a scenario, each with three heroes of their choice and a deck of allies, events and attachments to support them. Each round, players send their heroes and allies to quest or to fight with enemies that engage them. However, as the heroes and allies exhaust after questing, defending, or attacking, the players' options are typically insufficient to deal with everything at once. Therefore, players need to determine whether it is more urgent to quest and make progress in the scenario while the enemy forces gain power, or to take down enemies while making no progress, not knowing what will come next.\r\n<em>The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game</em> is the base game of a Living Card Game for which new adventure packs are released monthly. The base game contains three scenarios, twelve famous characters from the works of J.R.R. Tolkien (including Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Denethor and Eowyn), and four pre-constructed player decks. Players can either use one of these decks or construct their own deck to increase their chances to be successful in the more challenging scenarios. The monthly adventure packs contain a new scenario, a new hero, and new player cards to be used in their deck. The base game is for 1-2 players, but with an additional base game the scenarios can be played with up to four players.\r\nAlthough this game is set in Tolkien's Middle Earth, the scenarios do not represent scenes from the books, but rather take place in the seventeen years from Bilbo's 111th birthday until Frodo's departure from the Shire.\r\nThe scenarios from saga-expansions do represent scenes from the books. Saga-expansions will form the Campaign Mode so that you can play all the saga quests that deal with the trilogy (+ Hobbit) together in one marathon campaign.",

You love it.<br /><br /><strong>Munchkin</strong> is the mega-hit card game about dungeon adventure . . . with none of that roleplaying stuff. You and your friends compete to kill monsters and grab magic items. And what magic items! Don the Horny Helmet and the Boots of Butt-Kicking. Wield the Staff of Napalm . . . or maybe the Chainsaw of Bloody Dismemberment. Start by slaughtering the Potted Plant and the Drooling Slime, and work your way up to the Plutonium Dragon . . .<br /><br />And it's illustrated by John Kovalic!<br /><br />Fast-playing and silly, Munchkin can reduce any roleplaying group to hysteria. And, while they're laughing, you can steal their stuff.\r\nThe Deluxe Edition has a big gameboard to keep your cards in place, and twelve player standies with plastic stands that you move on the gameboard as you level up!",

      "description_preview": " Go down in the dungeon. Kill everything you meet.  Backstab your friends and steal their stuff. Grab the treasure and run.  Admit it. You love it.   Munchkin  is the mega-hit card game about dungeon adventure . . . with none of that roleplaying stuff. You and your friends compete to kill monsters and grab magic items. And what magic items! Don the Horny Helmet and the Boots of Butt-Kicking. Wield the Staff of Napalm . . . or maybe the Chainsaw of Bloody Dismemberment. Start by slaughtering the Potted Plant and the Drooling Slime, and work your way up to the Plutonium Dragon . . .  And it's illustrated by John Kovalic!  Fast-playing and silly, Munchkin can reduce any roleplaying group to hysteria. And, while they're laughing, you can steal their stuff. \r\n The Deluxe Edition has a big gameboard to keep your cards in place, and twelve player standies with plastic stands that you move on the gameboard as you level up!

      "description": "71 Years Ago: The plague came out of nowhere and ravaged the world. Fever, cough, sores, and death - once infected, most died within a week. Nothing could stop it. The world did its best. It wasn't good enough.\r\nThe last fragments of our people have desperately kept the world from collapsing completely. For three generations we have lived on the seas, on floating stations they called &quot;havens.&quot; Far from the plague, we are able to provide supplies to the mainland - antibiotics, food, medicine, and tools - to keep them (and us) from succumbing completely. We keep a network of the largest known cities in the world alive. Things have been tough the past few years. Cities far away from the havens have fallen off the grid. We don't know what's happened to them. We don't know why the supplies aren't reaching them. We have only a few cities left on our gird. We are failing.\r\nA cooperative legacy game for two to four players, <strong>Pandemic Legacy: Season 2</strong> immerses players in a harrowing tale of survival. It is seventy-one years after the events of Pandemic Legacy: Season 1, and humanity has been brought to its knees. A network of the last known cities persists, supplied by the havens, isolated stations floating in the ocean far from the plague. Three generations of survivors have called the havens home. Most of them have never set foot on the mainland. But now supplies are running low and the people have turned to you to lead. It's up to you to save what remaining cities you can and stop the world from ending for good.",

      "description_preview": " 71 Years Ago: The plague came out of nowhere and ravaged the world. Fever, cough, sores, and death - once infected, most died within a week. Nothing could stop it. The world did its best. It wasn't good enough. \r\n The last fragments of our people have desperately kept the world from collapsing completely. For three generations we have lived on the seas, on floating stations they called \"havens.\" Far from the plague, we are able to provide supplies to the mainland - antibiotics, food, medicine, and tools - to keep them (and us) from succumbing completely. We keep a network of the largest known cities in the world alive. Things have been tough the past few years. Cities far away from the havens have fallen off the grid. We don't know what's happened to them. We don't know why the supplies aren't reaching them. We have only a few cities left on our gird. We are failing. \r\n A cooperative legacy game for two to four players,  Pandemic Legacy: Season 2  immerses players in a harrowing tale of survival. It is seventy-one years after the events of Pandemic Legacy: Season 1, and humanity has been brought to its knees. A network of the last known cities persists, supplied by the havens, isolated stations floating in the ocean far from the plague. Three generations of survivors have called the havens home. Most of them have never set foot on the mainland. But now supplies are running low and the people have turned to you to lead. It's up to you to save what remaining cities you can and stop the world from ending for good. "

      "description": "The excitement in the air is electric as the leaders round the last corner and head for the finish line. Each team has used cunning and skill to position their sprinter for this moment, but only one has done enough to pull off the win!<br /><br />Will your team lead from the front and risk exhaustion? Should you play it safe in the middle of the pack? Could you surprise everyone by striking from the back? Can you time your move perfectly?<br /><br />Anyone can race, few become champions!<br /><br />Flamme Rouge is a fast-paced, tactical bicycle racing game where each player controls a team of two riders: a Rouleur and a Sprinteur. The players' goal is to be the first to cross the finish line with one of their riders. Players move their riders forward by drawing and playing cards from that riders specific deck, depleting it as they go. Use slipstreams to avoid exhaustion and position your team for a well timed sprint for the win.",

      "description_preview": " The excitement in the air is electric as the leaders round the last corner and head for the finish line. Each team has used cunning and skill to position their sprinter for this moment, but only one has done enough to pull off the win!  Will your team lead from the front and risk exhaustion? Should you play it safe in the middle of the pack? Could you surprise everyone by striking from the back? Can you time your move perfectly?  Anyone can race, few become champions!  Flamme Rouge is a fast-paced, tactical bicycle racing game where each player controls a team of two riders: a Rouleur and a Sprinteur. The players' goal is to be the first to cross the finish line with one of their riders. Players move their riders forward by drawing and playing cards from that riders specific deck, depleting it as they go. Use slipstreams to avoid exhaustion and position your team for a well timed sprint for the win. "

Gameplay is for 1 - 4 players and typically lasts for 45 - 90 minutes. To play, you must make your way past the alarms and guards, find the stash and get to the roof to escape. But be careful - if anyone on your crew gets caught, it's all over.\r\n<strong>Game Contents</strong>&lt; /br&gt; - 124 Premium Square Cards, 48 Cardboard Tiles&lt; /br&gt; - 9 Character Meeples, 3 Guard Meeples&lt; /br&gt; - 9 Translucent Dice&lt; /br&gt; - 73 Tokens&lt; /br&gt; - 24 Wood Walls&lt; /br&gt; - Colored Instructions&lt; /br&gt;&lt; /br&gt; <strong>Product Reviews</strong>\r\n&quot;Finally, a heist movie that fits on your tabletop!&quot; - <strong>Raph Koster</strong>\r\n&quot;Burgle Bros is an intense co-op game with great replay value. It's very thematic, easy to learn and moves quick. You'll love how the tension ramps up as the game progresses.&quot; - <strong>Reza Lackey</strong>\r\n&quot;Don't let the kiddie title fool you, Burgle Bros is an intensely strategic game filled with fun, highly thematic moments. Have you ever wanted to pull off a huge heist? This is the closest you'll get without breaking the law.&quot; - <strong>Peter Sciretta</strong>\r\n&quot;It's a light-ish co-op where you feel your world closing in, and like there's NO WAY you can get out unseen by the guards. Great tension, and I'm guessing great relief if you can get out in time. I wouldn't know, since the guards spotted us. But NEXT TIME...!&quot; - <strong>Rich Sommer</strong>\r\n&quot;I enjoyed the game and it felt like my decisions mattered. I like the way the game makes you do real co-op, having to coordinate your actions nearly all of the time. You definitely can't just daydream during other player's turns.&quot; - <strong>Darron Shaffer</strong>",

      "description_preview": "  Overview  \r\n Burgle Bros is a cooperative boardgame where you assemble a crew, make a plan, and pull off the impossible heist! Gameplay is for 1 - 4 players and typically lasts for 45 - 90 minutes. To play, you must make your way past the alarms and guards, find the stash and get to the roof to escape. But be careful - if anyone on your crew gets caught, it's all over. \r\n  Game Contents < /br> - 124 Premium Square Cards, 48 Cardboard Tiles< /br> - 9 Character Meeples, 3 Guard Meeples< /br> - 9 Translucent Dice< /br> - 73 Tokens< /br> - 24 Wood Walls< /br> - Colored Instructions< /br>< /br>  Product Reviews  \r\n \"Finally, a heist movie that fits on your tabletop!\" -  Raph Koster  \r\n \"Burgle Bros is an intense co-op game with great replay value. It's very thematic, easy to learn and moves quick. You'll love how the tension ramps up as the game progresses.\" -  Reza Lackey  \r\n \"Don't let the kiddie title fool you, Burgle Bros is an intensely strategic game filled with fun, highly thematic moments. Have you ever wanted to pull off a huge heist? This is the closest you'll get without breaking the law.\" -  Peter Sciretta  \r\n \"It's a light-ish co-op where you feel your world closing in, and like there's NO WAY you can get out unseen by the guards. Great tension, and I'm guessing great relief if you can get out in time. I wouldn't know, since the guards spotted us. But NEXT TIME...!\" -  Rich Sommer  \r\n \"I enjoyed the game and it felt like my decisions mattered. I like the way the game makes you do real co-op, having to coordinate your actions nearly all of the time. You definitely can't just daydream during other player's turns.\" -  Darron Shaffer  "

      "description": "Your pulse races as diamond fever rises. No wonder: the adventurers delve into the cave, which is sparkling with diamonds, and try to bring our as many jewels as possible. But uncanny dangers and malicious researchers play an evil game in the cave. Now you must flee or risk everything in order to win with the largest treasure.\r\n<strong>Diamant</strong> (also published as <strong>Incan Gold</strong>) is a quick, fun game of bluff and daring in which explorers push their luck while exploring in search of gold and treasure. In each round, you decide whether to delve deeper into the temple, adding to your riches, or escape with the share you've acquired so far. Every time an explorer braves new territory, more gems and dangers appear. Giant spiders, mummies and fire can cause you to lose everything. Is it worth the risk? You decide. But if you leave, those who remain in the temple may acquire a bigger share of each stash of jewels yet to be found.\r\n<strong>Incan Gold:</strong>\r\nYou and your fellow adventurers explore the ruins of an ancient Incan temple, looking for turquoise, obsidian, and gold. At every turn, you must decide whether to play it safe by returning to camp with the treasure you've gathered so far; or to be a truly intrepid adventurer and keep on exploring.\r\nGoing farther into the ruins means risking your treasure by falling victim to giant spiders, wandering mummies, fire spouts, and venomous snakes! But priceless Incan artifacts are rumored to exist here...and you can be the one to discover them if you conquer your fears and forge ahead!",

No wonder: the adventurers delve into the cave, which is sparkling with diamonds, and try to bring our as many jewels as possible. But uncanny dangers and malicious researchers play an evil game in the cave. Now you must flee or risk everything in order to win with the largest treasure. \r\n  Diamant  (also published as  Incan Gold ) is a quick, fun game of bluff and daring in which explorers push their luck while exploring in search of gold and treasure. In each round, you decide whether to delve deeper into the temple, adding to your riches, or escape with the share you've acquired so far. Every time an explorer braves new territory, more gems and dangers appear. Giant spiders, mummies and fire can cause you to lose everything. Is it worth the risk? You decide. But if you leave, those who remain in the temple may acquire a bigger share of each stash of jewels yet to be found. \r\n  Incan Gold:  \r\n You and your fellow adventurers explore the ruins of an ancient Incan temple, looking for turquoise, obsidian, and gold. At every turn, you must decide whether to play it safe by returning to camp with the treasure you've gathered so far; or to be a truly intrepid adventurer and keep on exploring. \r\n Going farther into the ruins means risking your treasure by falling victim to giant spiders, wandering mummies, fire spouts, and venomous snakes! But priceless Incan artifacts are rumored to exist here...and you can be the one to discover them if you conquer your fears and forge ahead! "

      "description": "Lisboa is a game about the reconstruction of the great Portuguese capital city after a series of terrible catastrophes. On November 1, 1755, Lisboa suffered an earthquake of an estimated magnitude of 8.5-9.0, followed by a devastating tsunami and 3 days of raging fires. The city was almost totally destroyed.<br /><br />Lisboa is thus played, in part, on a representational map of the city. During the planning of the downtown re-building project, the type of businesses permitted in each street was pre-determined. The clockmakers and goldsmiths had their street; as did the bookstores and libraries; the tailors and silk vendors; and the toolmakers as well. This all comes into play on the Lisboa gameboard. <br /><br />Players represent the nobility of Lisboa who will use their influence in the reconstruction and business development of the new city. <br /><br />In rebuilding the city, players will make use of the Royal Builder, who works with the architects to build Lisboa anew, while the Marquis will provide aid in the development of commerce. The King will provide players with political help in re-opening the beautiful new city. But the true reason you are rebuilding the city is not for greatness, or even fame or fortune. As a nobleman or noblewoman of Lisboa, your primary motivation is the acquisition of Wigs--a most important trading commodity of the Era, and the means of scoring points in the game.",

      "description_preview": " Lisboa is a game about the reconstruction of the great Portuguese capital city after a series of terrible catastrophes. On November 1, 1755, Lisboa suffered an earthquake of an estimated magnitude of 8.5-9.0, followed by a devastating tsunami and 3 days of raging fires. The city was almost totally destroyed.  Lisboa is thus played, in part, on a representational map of the city. During the planning of the downtown re-building project, the type of businesses permitted in each street was pre-determined. The clockmakers and goldsmiths had their street; as did the bookstores and libraries; the tailors and silk vendors; and the toolmakers as well. This all comes into play on the Lisboa gameboard.   Players represent the nobility of Lisboa who will use their influence in the reconstruction and business development of the new city.   In rebuilding the city, players will make use of the Royal Builder, who works with the architects to build Lisboa anew, while the Marquis will provide aid in the development of commerce. The King will provide players with political help in re-opening the beautiful new city. But the true reason you are rebuilding the city is not for greatness, or even fame or fortune. As a nobleman or noblewoman of Lisboa, your primary motivation is the acquisition of Wigs--a most important trading commodity of the Era, and the means of scoring points in the game. "

      "description": "Imhotep. The legendary architect of the Egyptian monuments. His awe-inspiring structures and brutal tactics earned him divine status among ancient Egyptians. Can you match his ruthless determination to build the most revered monuments?<br /><br />To do this, you will need to transport stone blocks on ships from your quarry to different construction sites. But you alone do not choose where the ships go. Your opponents have monumental plans of their own and want to prevent your success. A fierce competition for the precious stone resources plays out. Only with the right strategy and a little luck can you succeed.<br /><br />In Imhotep, the players take on the roles of ancient Egyptian architects. Over six rounds, they try to transport their stone blocks to end up in the most valuable positions at five construction sites: pyramid, obelisk, chamber tomb, temple, and market. But a player can only choose one of three actions in a turn: excavate a new stone block from the quarry, load a block onto a ship, or move a ship to a construction site. From there, the massive stone blocks must be unloaded in order from bow to stern and placed on the sites in preset sequences. Depending on where the blocks end up, players earn different point values either immediately or at the end of the game.<br /><br />In each turn, you must weigh your options for getting your own stones into place and thwarting your opponents' placement plans. You must get your blocks to the right places, in the right order, at the right time to be the greatest architect.",

Each player gets a set of 21 pieces – in red, blue, green, or yellow – then takes turns placing them on the board. There’s just one rule: each piece you play must touch at least one other piece of the same color, but only at the corners! The goal is to fit the most pieces on the board. The game ends when no more pieces can be placed down, and the player with the lowest number remaining wins!",

It takes less than a minute to learn, but offers endless strategy and fun challenges for the whole family. Each player gets a set of 21 pieces – in red, blue, green, or yellow – then takes turns placing them on the board. There’s just one rule: each piece you play must touch at least one other piece of the same color, but only at the corners! The goal is to fit the most pieces on the board. The game ends when no more pieces can be placed down, and the player with the lowest number remaining wins! "

Each turn, the players bid for the favors of the Gods, as only one player can have the favor of each God per turn - and each player is also limited to the favor of a single God per turn.  -Ares allows the movement of player armies and the building of Fortresses. -Poseidon allows players to move their navies and build Ports. -Zeus allows his followers to hire priests and build temples. -Athena provides her worshipers with philosophers and universities. -Apollo increases the income of his worshippers.

      "description": "A little mandrake root, a little raven's feather. Toss them in the cauldron and see what they make. Should you drink it? Maybe not. After all, that's what students are for.<br /><br />Welcome to the world of Alchemists! Perform experiments to discover the magical properties of your ingredients. Demonstrate your knowledge by selling potions. Use the money to buy artifacts that further your research. Publish, publish, publish! Earn grants. And expose the fallacies published by those fools who think they can be your rivals.<br /><br />Alchemists is a game of strategy, risk assessment, and deduction. Do you experiment to get more knowledge or do you publish now to get more points? Pay to endorse the latest theory of toads or save your money for an artifact? And should you really be selling that potion to the large axe-wielding barbarian when you aren't quite sure of its effects? The choices you make will prove whether you are the world's greatest alchemist.<br /><br />This game is designed to be played using an app that turns your tablet or smartphone into an ingredient card reader. The app is available for free. Supported operating systems are: iOS, Android, Windows. If, for whatever reason, you don't want to use the mobile app, you can still use the web-based version or play with one player acting as the game master.",

      "description_preview": " A little mandrake root, a little raven's feather. Toss them in the cauldron and see what they make. Should you drink it? Maybe not. After all, that's what students are for.  Welcome to the world of Alchemists! Perform experiments to discover the magical properties of your ingredients. Demonstrate your knowledge by selling potions. Use the money to buy artifacts that further your research. Publish, publish, publish! Earn grants. And expose the fallacies published by those fools who think they can be your rivals.  Alchemists is a game of strategy, risk assessment, and deduction. Do you experiment to get more knowledge or do you publish now to get more points? Pay to endorse the latest theory of toads or save your money for an artifact? And should you really be selling that potion to the large axe-wielding barbarian when you aren't quite sure of its effects? The choices you make will prove whether you are the world's greatest alchemist.  This game is designed to be played using an app that turns your tablet or smartphone into an ingredient card reader. The app is available for free. Supported operating systems are: iOS, Android, Windows. If, for whatever reason, you don't want to use the mobile app, you can still use the web-based version or play with one player acting as the game master. "

      "description": "While empires rise and fall in Eastern Europa, the rest of the world takes notice. Two distant factions, Albion and Togawa, send emissaries to scout the land and employ their own distinct styles of conquering.<br /><br />This expansion to Scythe adds 2 new factions, each with 5 miniatures, 31 custom wooden tokens, and 1 faction mat. It also includes new cardboard tokens, 2 new player mats, 6 Automa cards, and a custom plastic insert designed to fit into the expansion box or the original Scythe box. The expansion works seamlessly with any version of Scythe.<br /><br />The originally game was capped at 5 players, but with 2 new player mats in the expansion 6-7 player games can be played. To scale up, the expansion includes alternate abilities for some of the original factions.",

Two distant factions, Albion and Togawa, send emissaries to scout the land and employ their own distinct styles of conquering.  This expansion to Scythe adds 2 new factions, each with 5 miniatures, 31 custom wooden tokens, and 1 faction mat. It also includes new cardboard tokens, 2 new player mats, 6 Automa cards, and a custom plastic insert designed to fit into the expansion box or the original Scythe box. The expansion works seamlessly with any version of Scythe.  The originally game was capped at 5 players, but with 2 new player mats in the expansion 6-7 player games can be played. To scale up, the expansion includes alternate abilities for some of the original factions. "

Players take the roles of investigators racing against time to stave off the imminent return of the Ancient One. Armed with tools, allies, and occult knowledge, investigators must put their sanity and stamina to the test as they adventure to locate Elder Signs, the eldritch symbols used to seal away the Ancient Ones and win the game.",

It is up to four students to ensure the safety of the school by defeating villains and consolidating their defenses. Players take on the role of a Hogwarts student: Harry, Ron, Hermione or Neville, each with his or her own personal deck of cards. <br /><br />To secure the castle from the forces of evil the students must work together to build more powerful decks using iconic Wizarding World characters, spells, and items. Defeat all the villains including He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named and win the game!\r\nBy gaining influence, players add more cards to their deck in the form of iconic characters, spells, and magical items. Other cards allow them to regain health or fight against villains, keeping them from gaining power. The villains set back players with their attacks and Dark Arts. Only by working together will players be able to defeat all of the villains, securing the castle from the forces of evil.",

It is up to four students to ensure the safety of the school by defeating villains and consolidating their defenses. Players take on the role of a Hogwarts student: Harry, Ron, Hermione or Neville, each with his or her own personal deck of cards.   To secure the castle from the forces of evil the students must work together to build more powerful decks using iconic Wizarding World characters, spells, and items. Defeat all the villains including He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named and win the game! \r\n By gaining influence, players add more cards to their deck in the form of iconic characters, spells, and magical items. Other cards allow them to regain health or fight against villains, keeping them from gaining power. The villains set back players with their attacks and Dark Arts. Only by working together will players be able to defeat all of the villains, securing the castle from the forces of evil. "

      "description": "<strong>Third edition:</strong>\r\nThe most notorious vampire of all rises again in the third edition of Fury of Dracula, a board game of deduction and gothic horror based on Bram Stoker's classic novel. One player takes control of the legendary Count Dracula as he stealthily crosses Victorian-era Europe, spreading his diabolical vampirism everywhere he goes. Up to four other players govern Mina Harker and her determined companions as they try to locate and destroy the fiendish Count before he plunges Europe into horrific darkness. But in this heated game of cat and mouse, the hunted prey may also be preying on his hunters. Any day's travel might bring the hunters to Dracula's location. On any night the Count may attack.\r\nThis edition features all-new art and graphic design crafted to complement the game's intuitive, thematic mechanics. Rounds are now broken into day and night: hunters take actions during both, but Dracula can only act at night. Combat is now more streamlined and decisive, and new rumor tokens allow Dracula to mislead hunters and extend the terrible reach of his influence. Count Dracula triumphs if he advances his influence track to thirteen; if the hunters can defeat him before then, they save the continent of Europe and win the game.\r\n<strong>Fourth edition:</strong>\r\nThe fourth edition of <em>Fury of Dracula</em> contains pre-painted miniatures instead of unpainted figures.",

      "description_preview": "  Third edition:  \r\n The most notorious vampire of all rises again in the third edition of Fury of Dracula, a board game of deduction and gothic horror based on Bram Stoker's classic novel. One player takes control of the legendary Count Dracula as he stealthily crosses Victorian-era Europe, spreading his diabolical vampirism everywhere he goes. Up to four other players govern Mina Harker and her determined companions as they try to locate and destroy the fiendish Count before he plunges Europe into horrific darkness. But in this heated game of cat and mouse, the hunted prey may also be preying on his hunters. Any day's travel might bring the hunters to Dracula's location. On any night the Count may attack. \r\n This edition features all-new art and graphic design crafted to complement the game's intuitive, thematic mechanics. Rounds are now broken into day and night: hunters take actions during both, but Dracula can only act at night. Combat is now more streamlined and decisive, and new rumor tokens allow Dracula to mislead hunters and extend the terrible reach of his influence. Count Dracula triumphs if he advances his influence track to thirteen; if the hunters can defeat him before then, they save the continent of Europe and win the game. \r\n  Fourth edition:  \r\n The fourth edition of  Fury of Dracula  contains pre-painted miniatures instead of unpainted figures.

      "description": "A mad scientist holds the world hostage with his terrifying inventions. An alien warlord from a far away galaxy brings his limitless army of bizarre minions to conquer the planet. A giant rampaging robot cuts a swath of destruction across the coast, destroying major population centers. And who will stand in their way? A team of heroes, all with impressive powers and abilities stand between the world and the forces of evil. Will you help them? Answer the call to protect the multiverse.\r\nSentinels of the Multiverse is a cooperative, fixed-deck card game with a comic book flavor. Each player plays as one of ten heroes, against one of four villains and the battle takes place in one of four different dynamic environments.\r\nThe Sentinels of the Multiverse: Enhanced Edition features a much larger box than our original print run, with enough space to hold 578 cards and still have room for all the cards from both the Rook City and Infernal Relics expansions. The Enhanced Edition also features 36 divider cards, one for each hero, villain and environment from the core game, both expansions and even promo characters. The 120 round tokens and 42 rectangular tokens are useful for tracking hero and villain HP, as well as conditional modifiers that can occur throughout the game. The game also includes a 20 page rulebook, complete with instructions, diagrams, a quick-start guide and even bios of the heroes and villains.",

They're all rivals, but their budgets force them all to share a single rented submarine. In the rented submarine, they all have to share a single tank of air, as well. If they don't get back to the sub before they run out of air, they'll drop all their treasure. Now it's time to see who can bring home the greatest riches.<br /><br />The game takes place over 3 rounds, and the player to gain the most points over the 3 rounds is the winner. In order to gain points, you must bring the most ruins chips back to the submarine. You can only return to the submarine once per round, and you cannot progress more after returning. You cannot return to the submarine without bringing any ruins chips.",

They're all rivals, but their budgets force them all to share a single rented submarine. In the rented submarine, they all have to share a single tank of air, as well. If they don't get back to the sub before they run out of air, they'll drop all their treasure. Now it's time to see who can bring home the greatest riches.  The game takes place over 3 rounds, and the player to gain the most points over the 3 rounds is the winner. In order to gain points, you must bring the most ruins chips back to the submarine. You can only return to the submarine once per round, and you cannot progress more after returning. You cannot return to the submarine without bringing any ruins chips. "

Traits like Hard Shell and Horns will protect you from Carnivores, while a Long Neck will help you get food that others cannot reach. With over 12000 different species to create, every game becomes a different adventure. So gather your friends around the table and see who will best adapt their species to eat, multiply and thrive! "
