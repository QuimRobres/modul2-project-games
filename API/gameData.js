New characters take their places along new versions of iconic figures such as Jedi Master Yoda. You'll gain access to powerful new strategies and opportunities in this Force Pack, whether you train in the swamps of Dagobah or pursue the second phase of the Dark Trooper Project. Meanwhile, the Rebel Alliance recruit the secret agent known as Winter to engage in covert espionage on Imperial activity, and Jawa raiders scour the sands of Tatooine in search of easy prey. With the ten objective sets (two copies each of five different objective sets) included in this Force Pack, you will learn to draw upon the power of the Force, no matter how you respond to the dark side's ultimatum - Join Us or Die!

        "description": "<p>Two great powers struggle for the fate of the galaxy across the Star Wars saga. On one side, you find the fledgling Rebel Alliance, led by a few brave politicians and desperately fighting for the hearts and minds of people on countless planets. The Rebels stand against the tyranny of the Empire and spread hopes of freedom and justice across worlds choking on fear of military reprisal. Opposing the Rebels stands the might of the Galactic Empire, a monolithic government stretching across hundreds of planets that answers to one man alone. From his palace on Imperial Center, the Sith Lord publicly known as Emperor Palpatine rules the galaxy with the might of the Imperial military and the power of his apprentice, Darth Vader. Though they spent centuries waiting in the shadows, the Sith have risen to rule the galaxy, and they will crush the nascent Rebel Alliance by any means necessary. Galactic Ambitions pits these two powers against each other in a struggle for the galaxy itself.</p>\r\n<p>Like previous deluxe expansions, the twenty-six new objective sets included in Galactic Ambitions fix the spotlight on two factions-the Sith and the Rebel Alliance-but every faction receives cards that push your decks in new directions. Here, you'll find an assortment of iconic characters to include in your decks, such as new versions of Darth Vader, Emperor Palpatine, Leia Organa, and Mon Mothma. Other characters make an appearance in Star Wars: The Card Game for the first time, including Kanan Jarrus and The Inquisitor from Star Wars: Rebels, as well as General Jan Dodonna. Whether you're fighting to free the galaxy or to squelch any trace of resistance, Galactic Ambitions offers new strategies and cards to support new deck types.</p>",

        "description_preview": " Two great powers struggle for the fate of the galaxy across the Star Wars saga. On one side, you find the fledgling Rebel Alliance, led by a few brave politicians and desperately fighting for the hearts and minds of people on countless planets. The Rebels stand against the tyranny of the Empire and spread hopes of freedom and justice across worlds choking on fear of military reprisal. Opposing the Rebels stands the might of the Galactic Empire, a monolithic government stretching across hundreds of planets that answers to one man alone. From his palace on Imperial Center, the Sith Lord publicly known as Emperor Palpatine rules the galaxy with the might of the Imperial military and the power of his apprentice, Darth Vader. Though they spent centuries waiting in the shadows, the Sith have risen to rule the galaxy, and they will crush the nascent Rebel Alliance by any means necessary. Galactic Ambitions pits these two powers against each other in a struggle for the galaxy itself. \r\n Like previous deluxe expansions, the twenty-six new objective sets included in Galactic Ambitions fix the spotlight on two factions-the Sith and the Rebel Alliance-but every faction receives cards that push your decks in new directions. Here, you'll find an assortment of iconic characters to include in your decks, such as new versions of Darth Vader, Emperor Palpatine, Leia Organa, and Mon Mothma. Other characters make an appearance in Star Wars: The Card Game for the first time, including Kanan Jarrus and The Inquisitor from Star Wars: Rebels, as well as General Jan Dodonna. Whether you're fighting to free the galaxy or to squelch any trace of resistance, Galactic Ambitions offers new strategies and cards to support new deck types. "

Sixty new cards (three copies each of twenty individual cards) introduce players to the northern SanSan borough of Chrome City. Here, among the sketchy chop shops planted in the shadow of Haas-Bioroid's genetics division, a growing community of chromeheads have begun to transform cybernetics into fashion statements. If the surgery's good, the latest cybernetics don't just make you trendy; they also make you smarter, stronger, and more resilient. But a bad chopper's just as likely to cause you irreparable brain damage as outfit you for the runways. Accordingly, Chrome City and its cybernetic hardware introduce a volatile mixture of risks and rewards, many of which are centered around protecting or damaging the Runner's brain.</p>",

        "description_preview": " Function breeds fashion in Chrome City, the third Data Pack in the SanSan Cycle for Android: Netrunner! Sixty new cards (three copies each of twenty individual cards) introduce players to the northern SanSan borough of Chrome City. Here, among the sketchy chop shops planted in the shadow of Haas-Bioroid's genetics division, a growing community of chromeheads have begun to transform cybernetics into fashion statements. If the surgery's good, the latest cybernetics don't just make you trendy; they also make you smarter, stronger, and more resilient. But a bad chopper's just as likely to cause you irreparable brain damage as outfit you for the runways. Accordingly, Chrome City and its cybernetic hardware introduce a volatile mixture of risks and rewards, many of which are centered around protecting or damaging the Runner's brain. "

However, now and again, he feels the ley-lines pull and twang sharply, which shouldn't happen. He'll travel from one place to another, easing the tension on the lines by stopping the odd, extra-planar entity from entering this dimension, or keeping the crazed scientist from pulling the moon into the earth, or halting the nightmarish legions of a comatose little girl. Sometimes, he'll work with other gentle souls to accomplish his goal - he doesn't mind a little company now and then. Mainly he just wants to keep things copacetic.</p>\r\n<p><strong>The Scholar</strong> is a hero character with his own unique deck of 40 hero cards and a character card.

As with the original, the board has a different map on each side: France and Italy. Along with the maps are small rule changes to reflect the power culture in these two countries. France, a land that has embraced nuclear power, has an earlier start with atomic plants and more uranium available. Italy has more waste, but fewer coal and oil resources. The result is not just new maps, but new ways to play this great game!</p>",

        "description_preview": " Two new maps for Power Grid. This is an expansion pack, so you will need the Power Grid game to play. As with the original, the board has a different map on each side: France and Italy. Along with the maps are small rule changes to reflect the power culture in these two countries. France, a land that has embraced nuclear power, has an earlier start with atomic plants and more uranium available. Italy has more waste, but fewer coal and oil resources. The result is not just new maps, but new ways to play this great game! "
