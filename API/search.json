      "commentary": "<p>During a car ride, designer Cole and his wife were listening to an audio book of T. H. White's <strong>The Once and Future King</strong>. When the Monarch of Moat delivered the following line to Arthur, it spawned a series of ideas creating the framework for Root, a game of Might and Right: &quot;...There is only power. Power is of the individual mind, but the mind's power is not enough. Power of the body decides everything in the end, and only Might is Right.&quot;</p>",
      "faq": "<h4>Frequently Asked Questions</h4>\r\n<p><strong>Who goes first?</strong></p>\r\n<p>According to the official rules, your group determines the starting player and seating order randomly (Rule 5.1.1). After the starting player finishes their turn, the next clockwise player begins their turn (Rule 1.5). A common house (unofficial) rule among fans is to have the Marquise (Cat) faction start the game especially at 4 or more player counts.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Is this a good 2-player game?</strong></p>\r\n<p>While some may still enjoy the 2-player gameplay (and I am one of them), it's not the ideal player count due to limited number of viable faction combinations. Every faction has an assigned \"Reach Value\" that represents the amount of influence they can have over the board state, and Leder Games recommends that the total Reach Value should equal or exceed the minimum indicated for the player count (see table below). For example, for 2-player gameplay using the base game, the only viable factions are Marquise and Eyrie.</p>\r\n<p><img class=\"w-50\" src=\"https://d2k4q26owzy373.cloudfront.net/700x700/games/userfiles/1613783703105-root%20faction%20reach%20values.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\r\n<p>If you want to have a fuller experience at a 2-player count, here are some options:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Get <a class=\"game-preview\" href=\"/game/AMEwdJGV5c/root-the-clockwork-expansion\" data-tipped-options=\"ajax: {data: { ids: 'AMEwdJGV5c', client_id: 'W0AQGbjlZE' }}\">Root: The Clockwork Expansion</a> - Adds simulated opponent(s).

Other than each player's individual hidden objective card, the only elements of luck or variability are &quot;Encounter&quot; cards that players will draw as they interact with the citizens of newly explored lands. Each encounter card provides the player with several options, allowing them to mitigate the luck of the draw through their selection. Combat is also driven by choices, not luck or randomness.<br /><br /><em>Scythe</em> uses a streamlined action-selection mechanism (no rounds or phases) to keep gameplay moving at a brisk pace and reduce downtime between turns. While there is plenty of direct conflict for players who seek it, there is no player elimination.<br /><br />Every part of <em>Scythe</em> has an aspect of engine-building to it. Players can upgrade actions to become more efficient, build structures that improve their position on the map, enlist new recruits to enhance character abilities, activate mechs to deter opponents from invading, and expand their borders to reap greater types and quantities of resources. These engine-building aspects create a sense of momentum and progress throughout the game. The order in which players improve their engine adds to the unique feel of each game, even when playing one faction multiple times.</p>",

      "description_preview": "  Scythe  gives players almost complete control over their fate. Other than each player's individual hidden objective card, the only elements of luck or variability are \"Encounter\" cards that players will draw as they interact with the citizens of newly explored lands. Each encounter card provides the player with several options, allowing them to mitigate the luck of the draw through their selection. Combat is also driven by choices, not luck or randomness.   Scythe  uses a streamlined action-selection mechanism (no rounds or phases) to keep gameplay moving at a brisk pace and reduce downtime between turns. While there is plenty of direct conflict for players who seek it, there is no player elimination.  Every part of  Scythe  has an aspect of engine-building to it. Players can upgrade actions to become more efficient, build structures that improve their position on the map, enlist new recruits to enhance character abilities, activate mechs to deter opponents from invading, and expand their borders to reap greater types and quantities of resources. These engine-building aspects create a sense of momentum and progress throughout the game. The order in which players improve their engine adds to the unique feel of each game, even when playing one faction multiple times. "

      "description": "<p><em><strong>Wingspan</strong></em> is a competitive, medium-weight, card-driven, engine-building board game from Stonemaier Games.</p>\r\n<p>You are bird enthusiasts—researchers, bird watchers, ornithologists, and collectors—seeking to discover and attract the best birds to your aviary. Each bird extends a chain of powerful combinations in one of your habitats (actions). These habitats focus on several key aspects of growth:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Gain food tokens via custom dice in a birdfeeder dice tower</li>\r\n<li>Lay eggs using egg miniatures in a variety of colors</li>\r\n<li>Draw from hundreds of unique bird cards and play them</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The winner is the player with the most points after 4 rounds.</p>",
      "commentary": "<ul>\r\n<li>Wingspan's artists, Ana and Natalia, have been friends since high school in Colombia. After Natalia moved to the U.S., she ran into <a href=\"/designer/MANNUPclkd/alan-stone\" target=\"_blank\">Alan Stone</a> through their kids' school, which led to her getting connected with <a href=\"/designer/QIz5pAPzFk/jamey-stegmaier\" target=\"_blank\">Jamey Stegmaier</a> of <a href=\"/publisher/njVFVNfJc7/stonemaier-games\" target=\"_blank\">Stonemaier Games</a>. Check out this interview <a href=\"/forum/XTO9WbDBqe/how-the-best-board-game-of-2019-wingspan-reunited-two-high-school-friends-interview\" target=\"_blank\">here</a></li>\r\n<li>In an interview, designer <a href=\"/designer/UBhK4cSEV6/elizabeth-hargrave\" target=\"_blank\">Elizabeth Hargrave</a> commented that she felt &quot;... there were too many games about castles and space, and not enough games about things I'm interested in. So I decided to make a game about something I cared about.&quot;</li>\r\n</ul>",
      "faq": "<h4>Frequently Asked Questions</h4>\r\n<p><strong>Is it hard to learn?</strong></p>\r\n<p>The rulebook is well-organized and easy to follow. You can learn how to play the game after reading through 10 pages of rules accompanied by plenty of visual cues and breathing space between text. Alternatively, you can use the Quick-Reference Guide (page 2 of the Appendix) if you want to learn the game in real-time.</p>\r\n<p>Veteran gamers will find it relatively easy to learn and teach, while new gamers may feel that it's more complex than what they're used to. When it comes to learning the actual strategy, the game will likely \"click\" for the majority of the players by the time your group finishes the 1st Round (there are 4 Rounds total).</p>\r\n<p>Due to the game's simple turn structure and types of actions available, you'll quickly pick up on how the game works by watching your friends play. So while you may not be playing optimally or finding the best combos to pull off, you'll likely feel comfortable by the start of Round 2.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>For those who've played Stonemaier Games' <a class=\"game-preview\" href=\"/game/7NYbgH2Z2I/viticulture-essential-edition\" data-tipped-options=\"ajax: {data: { ids: '7NYbgH2Z2I', client_id: 'W0AQGbjlZE' }}\">Viticulture: Essential Edition</a>, Wingspan is less complex than Viticulture in terms of strategy elements and has fewer rules to memorize. If you have detailed questions about the game, you'll likely find an answer within this <a href=\"https://stonemaiergames.com/games/wingspan/rules/\">comprehensive FAQ</a> put together by Stonemaier Games.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Is it good for 2 players?</strong></p>\r\n<p>2-player gameplay won't trigger pink bird powers as frequently, which are activated once per turn if a criteria is met during an opponent's turn (e.g. get \"X\" benefit when another player does \"Y\" action). There will also be less competition for valuable birds cards or for the food dice from the birdfeeder.</p>\r\n<p>Wingspan is a relatively low interaction game. This means that the gameplay won't feel much different at low or high player counts and makes for an easily scalable game. So if you love Wingspan at high player counts, you'll love it at 2-player count as well. On the other hand, if you're someone who prefers highly interactive games where your actions directly impact another player's strategies, you should try it out before making the purchase.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Is there a hand limit?</strong></p>\r\n<p>There is no limit to the number of bird cards you can have in your hand.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Can you play alone?</strong></p>\r\n<p>As with most Stonemaier Games titles, Wingspan comes with a separate set of rules for the Automa, an AI opponent that simulates playing against a human opponent. This game was rated #13 on \"2020 People's Choice Top 200 Solo Games.\"</p>\r\n<p><strong>Who goes first?</strong></p>\r\n<p>The first player is randomnly selected by your group. That player gets the first-player token and will kick off the game.</p>\r\n<p><strong>How do you win?</strong></p>\r\n<p>The player with the most points wins. Tally up points for the following and determine the winner:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Points based on bird cards played on your tableau</li>\r\n<li>Points for bonus card(s) accomplished</li>\r\n<li>Points for end-of-round goals</li>\r\n<li>1 point for each:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Egg on a bird card</li>\r\n<li>Food token cached on a bird card</li>\r\n<li>Card tucked under a bird card</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In case of a tie, number of unused food tokens serve as tiebreaker. If still tied, they share the victory.</p>\r\n<p><strong>What's inside the box?</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>170 unique bird cards (57x87mm)</li>\r\n<li>26 bonus cards (57x87mm)</li>\r\n<li>16 Automa cards (57x87mm)</li>\r\n<li>103 food tokens</li>\r\n<li>75 egg miniatures</li>\r\n<li>5 custom wooden dice</li>\r\n<li>5 player mats</li>\r\n<li>1 birdfeeder dice tower</li>\r\n<li>2-piece Game Trayz custom tray</li>\r\n<li>1 goal mat</li>\r\n<li>8 goal tiles</li>\r\n<li>1 first-player token</li>\r\n<li>40 action cubes (8 per player)</li>\r\n<li>1 scorepad (50 sheets; 1 sheet used for all players each game)</li>\r\n<li>3 rulebooks</li>\r\n</ul>",

      "description": "<p>Gloomhaven is a game of Euro-inspired tactical combat in a persistent world of shifting motives. Players will take on the role of a wandering adventurer with their own special set of skills and their own reasons for traveling to this dark corner of the world.<br /><br />Players must work together out of necessity to clear out menacing dungeons and forgotten ruins. In the process they will enhance their abilities with experience and loot, discover new locations to explore and plunder, and expand an ever-branching story fueled by the decisions they make.<br /><br />This is a legacy game with a persistent and changing world that is ideally played over many game sessions. After a scenario, players will make decisions on what to do, which will determine how the story continues, kind of like a &quot;Choose Your Own Adventure&quot; book. Playing through a scenario is a cooperative affair where players will fight against automated monsters using an innovative card system to determine the order of play and what a player does on their turn.</p>",

      "description_preview": " Gloomhaven is a game of Euro-inspired tactical combat in a persistent world of shifting motives. Players will take on the role of a wandering adventurer with their own special set of skills and their own reasons for traveling to this dark corner of the world.  Players must work together out of necessity to clear out menacing dungeons and forgotten ruins. In the process they will enhance their abilities with experience and loot, discover new locations to explore and plunder, and expand an ever-branching story fueled by the decisions they make.  This is a legacy game with a persistent and changing world that is ideally played over many game sessions. After a scenario, players will make decisions on what to do, which will determine how the story continues, kind of like a \"Choose Your Own Adventure\" book. Playing through a scenario is a cooperative affair where players will fight against automated monsters using an innovative card system to determine the order of play and what a player does on their turn.

      "description": "<p>In the 2400s, mankind begins to terraform the planet Mars. Giant corporations, sponsored by the World Government on Earth, initiate huge projects to raise the temperature, the oxygen level and the ocean coverage until the environment is habitable. In Terraforming Mars you play one of those corporations and work together in the terraforming process, but compete in doing the best work, with victory points awarded not only for your contribution to the terraforming, but also for advancing human infrastructure throughout the solar systems and other commendable achievements. The players acquire unique project cards, which represent anything from introducing plant life or animals, hurling asteroids at the surface, building cities, and establishing greenhouse gas industries to heat up the atmosphere. You compete for the best places for your city tiles, ocean tiles and greenery tiles. When the terraforming process is complete, the player corporation with the most victory points wins.</p>",
      "commentary": "<p>FryxGames, the makers of Terraforming Mars, is a family business run by 5 brothers out of a family of 10 brothers, 6 sisters, and 2 parents. Even outside of the 5 brothers, most of the family is involved in the creation process one way or the other.</p>",

      "description_preview": " In the 2400s, mankind begins to terraform the planet Mars. Giant corporations, sponsored by the World Government on Earth, initiate huge projects to raise the temperature, the oxygen level and the ocean coverage until the environment is habitable. In Terraforming Mars you play one of those corporations and work together in the terraforming process, but compete in doing the best work, with victory points awarded not only for your contribution to the terraforming, but also for advancing human infrastructure throughout the solar systems and other commendable achievements. The players acquire unique project cards, which represent anything from introducing plant life or animals, hurling asteroids at the surface, building cities, and establishing greenhouse gas industries to heat up the atmosphere. You compete for the best places for your city tiles, ocean tiles and greenery tiles. When the terraforming process is complete, the player corporation with the most victory points wins. "

Azul captures the beautiful aesthetics of Moorish art in a contemporary board game.</p>\r\n<p>Players compete as artisans decorating the walls of the royal Palace of Dvora. By carefully drafting the correct Quantity and style of tiles, the most clever of artisans plan ahead to maximize the beauty of their work (not to mention their scores!) while ensuring they wasted no supplies in the process.</p>\r\n<p>Introduced by the moors, &quot;azulejos&quot; (originally white and blue ceramic tiles) were fully embraced by the Portuguese, when their King Manuel I, on a visit to the Alhambra Palace in Southern Spain, was mesmerized by the stunning beauty of the Moorish decorative tiles. The King, awestruck by the interior beauty of the Alhambra, immediately ordered that his own Palace in Portugal be decorated with similar wall tiles.</p>\r\n<p>As a tile-laying artist, you have been challenged to embellish the walls of the royal Palace of Dvora.</p>",

      "description_preview": "  Azul  was designed by the world famous, award-winning game author Michael Riesling. Azul captures the beautiful aesthetics of Moorish art in a contemporary board game. \r\n Players compete as artisans decorating the walls of the royal Palace of Dvora. By carefully drafting the correct Quantity and style of tiles, the most clever of artisans plan ahead to maximize the beauty of their work (not to mention their scores!) while ensuring they wasted no supplies in the process. \r\n Introduced by the moors, \"azulejos\" (originally white and blue ceramic tiles) were fully embraced by the Portuguese, when their King Manuel I, on a visit to the Alhambra Palace in Southern Spain, was mesmerized by the stunning beauty of the Moorish decorative tiles. The King, awestruck by the interior beauty of the Alhambra, immediately ordered that his own Palace in Portugal be decorated with similar wall tiles. \r\n As a tile-laying artist, you have been challenged to embellish the walls of the royal Palace of Dvora.

      "description": "<p>After five years of Pandemic, hundreds of thousands of players have contracted the virus! To celebrate this milestone, Pandemic has been completely re-designed. With new artwork by Chris Quilliams (Clash of Cultures, Merchants &amp; Marauders), Pandemic will now have a more modern look, inside and outside the box. With two new characters (the Contingency Planner and the Quarantine Specialist) face the game in ways you never thought possible as brand-new, virulent challenges await you!</p>\r\n<p>In <em><strong>Pandemic</strong></em>, several virulent diseases have broken out simultaneously all over the world! The players are disease-fighting specialists whose mission is to treat disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand.</p>\r\n<p>The game board depicts several major population centers on Earth. On each turn, a player can use up to four actions to travel between cities, treat infected populaces, discover a cure, or build a research station. A deck of cards provides the players with these abilities, but sprinkled throughout this deck are <em>Epidemic!</em> cards that accelerate and intensify the diseases' activity. A second, separate deck of cards controls the &quot;normal&quot; spread of the infections.</p>\r\n<p>Taking a unique role within the team, players must plan their strategy to mesh with their specialists' strengths in order to conquer the diseases. For example, the Operations Expert can build research stations which are needed to find cures for the diseases and which allow for greater mobility between cities; the Scientist needs only four cards of a particular disease to cure it instead of the normal five—but the diseases are spreading quickly and time is running out. If one or more diseases spreads beyond recovery or if too much time elapses, the players all lose. If they cure the four diseases, they all win!</p>\r\n<p>The 2013 edition of <em>Pandemic</em> includes two new characters—the Contingency Planner and the Quarantine Specialist—not available in earlier editions of the game.</p>\r\n<h4>Artists:</h4>\r\n<p>Joshua Cappel (graphics and illustration)</p>\r\n<p>Régis Moulun (cover painting)</p>\r\n<p>Chris Quilliams (2013 edition)<br /><br /><br /></p>",

      "description_preview": " After five years of Pandemic, hundreds of thousands of players have contracted the virus! To celebrate this milestone, Pandemic has been completely re-designed. With new artwork by Chris Quilliams (Clash of Cultures, Merchants & Marauders), Pandemic will now have a more modern look, inside and outside the box. With two new characters (the Contingency Planner and the Quarantine Specialist) face the game in ways you never thought possible as brand-new, virulent challenges await you! \r\n In   Pandemic  , several virulent diseases have broken out simultaneously all over the world! The players are disease-fighting specialists whose mission is to treat disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand. \r\n The game board depicts several major population centers on Earth. On each turn, a player can use up to four actions to travel between cities, treat infected populaces, discover a cure, or build a research station. A deck of cards provides the players with these abilities, but sprinkled throughout this deck are  Epidemic!  cards that accelerate and intensify the diseases' activity. A second, separate deck of cards controls the \"normal\" spread of the infections. \r\n Taking a unique role within the team, players must plan their strategy to mesh with their specialists' strengths in order to conquer the diseases. For example, the Operations Expert can build research stations which are needed to find cures for the diseases and which allow for greater mobility between cities; the Scientist needs only four cards of a particular disease to cure it instead of the normal five—but the diseases are spreading quickly and time is running out. If one or more diseases spreads beyond recovery or if too much time elapses, the players all lose. If they cure the four diseases, they all win! \r\n The 2013 edition of  Pandemic  includes two new characters—the Contingency Planner and the Quarantine Specialist—not available in earlier editions of the game. \r\n Artists: \r\n Joshua Cappel (graphics and illustration) \r\n Régis Moulun (cover painting) \r\n Chris Quilliams (2013 edition)    "

Native Islanders, known as the Dahan, have learned how to co-exist with the spirits, but with a healthy dose of fear and reverence. However, now, the island has been \"discovered\" by invaders from a far-off land. These would-be colonists are taking over the land and upsetting the natural balance, destroying the presence of Spirits as they go. As Spirits, you must grow in power and work together to drive the invaders from your island... before it's too late! "

      "faq": "<h4>Frequently Asked Questions</h4>\r\n<p><strong>How do you eplain this game?</strong></p>\r\n<p>This is a word-guessing game where two opposing teams compete to get in contact with all of their secret agents first by discovering their codenames. Each team has an assigned Spymaster who possesses a key card that reveals the location of all of the team's agents, and they must give a one word clue to help the team discover their agents. Take a risk by offering a clue that will point to as many of the secret agents, but you may unintentionally alert the assassin instead. (Here are the <a href=\"https://czechgames.com/files/rules/codenames-rules-en.pdf\">official rules in PDF</a>.)</p>\r\n<p><strong>What is the best version to buy?</strong></p>\r\n<p>The soaring popularity of Codenames spawned more than 11 different versions to choose from including Marvel, Harry Potter, Disney, and more. If you're looking for the best version that will strike a chord with the most diverse set of crowds, start with the original Codenames. If you're looking for a solid 2-player cooperative experience, get <a class=\"game-preview\" href=\"/game/9e0nNBNyOU/codenames-duet\" data-tipped-options=\"ajax: {data: { ids: '9e0nNBNyOU', client_id: 'W0AQGbjlZE' }}\">Codenames: Duet</a>.</p>\r\n<p><strong>How can I play online with my friends?</strong></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://codenames.game/\">Codenames Online</a> is the official free-to-play digital adaptation of the board game. Create a room, send the invite link, and catch up with friends and families by playing a fun board game alongside your usual Zoom meetings.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Can you play with 2 players?</strong></p>\r\n<p>The official rules include a 2-player variant to allow cooperative play against a simulated opponent. You can try this out even with a large group if they're not in the mood for competitive play. If you're looking for a strictly 2-player game, then I'd recommend <a class=\"game-preview\" href=\"/game/9e0nNBNyOU/codenames-duet\" data-tipped-options=\"ajax: {data: { ids: '9e0nNBNyOU', client_id: 'W0AQGbjlZE' }}\">Codenames: Duet</a>, which was specifically designed for a low player count.</p>\r\n<p><strong>How many guesses do you get every turn?</strong></p>\r\n<p>In every turn, the spymaster will say a one-word clue and a number, which tells the team how many codenames are associated with the clue. The team is allowed as many guesses as that number plus one extra. Taking this risk is a big part of the fun!</p>",

The teams compete to see who can make contact with all of their agents first. Spymasters give one-word clues that can point to multiple words on the board. Their teammates try to guess words of the right color while avoiding those that belong to the opposing team. And everyone wants to avoid the assassin.  Codenames: win or lose, it's fun to figure out the clues. "

Claim these features with your followers to win the game. \r\n  Carcassonne  is a tile placement game where players collectively construct the area around the medieval French city of Carcassonne while competing to place followers on various features and score the most points. \r\n First published in 2000, the game's accessible yet deep design has attracted a wide fan base and led to the development of numerous expansions (eg Rivers) and standalone titles in the  Carcassonne  line.

Over the course of 5 rounds, collect the most points by trading, live stock farming, city building and scientific research to win!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Hundred Years? war is over and the Renaissance is looming. Conditions are perfect for the princes of the Loire Valley to propel their estates to prosperity and prominence. Through strategic trading and building, clever planning, and careful thought, players add settlements and castles, practice trade along the river, exploit silver mines, farm livestock, and more in this classic Stefan Feld Eurogame.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHow to Play: 1. Players take turns rolling two dice and choosing to move goods tiles from the game board to their player boards; from their player boards onto corresponding numbered and colored regions of their playing fields; to deliver goods in exchange for silverlings; or to take worker tiles. 2. Play continues, with players completing additional actions and noting victory points for each tile placed. 3. Five turns are taken per round, with additional victory points awarded for unused money and workers, undelivered goods, and percentage of settlement complete. The player with the most victory points after five rounds wins the game.",

Over the course of 5 rounds, collect the most points by trading, live stock farming, city building and scientific research to win! \r\n \r\nThe Hundred Years? war is over and the Renaissance is looming. Conditions are perfect for the princes of the Loire Valley to propel their estates to prosperity and prominence. Through strategic trading and building, clever planning, and careful thought, players add settlements and castles, practice trade along the river, exploit silver mines, farm livestock, and more in this classic Stefan Feld Eurogame. \r\n \r\nHow to Play: 1. Players take turns rolling two dice and choosing to move goods tiles from the game board to their player boards; from their player boards onto corresponding numbered and colored regions of their playing fields; to deliver goods in exchange for silverlings; or to take worker tiles. 2. Play continues, with players completing additional actions and noting victory points for each tile placed. 3. Five turns are taken per round, with additional victory points awarded for unused money and workers, undelivered goods, and percentage of settlement complete. The player with the most victory points after five rounds wins the game."

      "description": "<p>The world is on the brink of disaster. In Pandemic Legacy, your disease-fighting team must keep four deadly diseases at bay for a whole year. Each month will bring new surprises, and your actions in each game will have repercussions on the next. Will you let cities fall to the diseases? Will your team be enough to keep the viruses at bay for a whole year? Craft your own unique Pandemic experience with Pandemic Legacy.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Pandemic Legacy</strong></em> is a co-operative campaign game, with an overarching story-arc played through 12-24 sessions, depending on how well your group does at the game. At the beginning, the game starts very similar to basic <em><a href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/30549/pandemic\">Pandemic</a></em>, in which your team of disease-fighting specialists races against the clock to travel around the world, treating disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand.</p>\r\n<p>During a player's turn, they have four actions available, with which they may travel around in the world in various ways (sometimes needing to discard a card), build structures like research stations, treat diseases (removing one cube from the board; if all cubes of a color have been removed, the disease has been eradicated), trade cards with other players, or find a cure for a disease (requiring five cards of the same color to be discarded while at a research station). Each player has a unique role with special abilities to help them at these actions.</p>\r\n<p>After a player has taken their actions, they draw two cards. These cards can include epidemic cards, which will place new disease cubes on the board, and can lead to an outbreak, spreading disease cubes even further. Outbreaks additionally increase the panic level of a city, making that city more expensive to travel to.</p>\r\n<p>Each month in the game, you have two chances to achieve that month's objectives. If you succeed, you win and immediately move on to the next month. If you fail, you have a second chance, with more funding for beneficial event cards.</p>\r\n<p>During the campaign, new rules and components will be introduced. These will sometimes require you to permanently alter the components of the game; this includes writing on cards, ripping up cards, and placing permanent stickers on components. Your characters can gain new skills, or detrimental effects. A character can even be lost entirely, at which point it's no longer available for play.</p>",

      "description_preview": " The world is on the brink of disaster. In Pandemic Legacy, your disease-fighting team must keep four deadly diseases at bay for a whole year. Each month will bring new surprises, and your actions in each game will have repercussions on the next. Will you let cities fall to the diseases? Will your team be enough to keep the viruses at bay for a whole year? Craft your own unique Pandemic experience with Pandemic Legacy. \r\n   Pandemic Legacy   is a co-operative campaign game, with an overarching story-arc played through 12-24 sessions, depending on how well your group does at the game. At the beginning, the game starts very similar to basic   Pandemic  , in which your team of disease-fighting specialists races against the clock to travel around the world, treating disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand. \r\n During a player's turn, they have four actions available, with which they may travel around in the world in various ways (sometimes needing to discard a card), build structures like research stations, treat diseases (removing one cube from the board; if all cubes of a color have been removed, the disease has been eradicated), trade cards with other players, or find a cure for a disease (requiring five cards of the same color to be discarded while at a research station). Each player has a unique role with special abilities to help them at these actions. \r\n After a player has taken their actions, they draw two cards. These cards can include epidemic cards, which will place new disease cubes on the board, and can lead to an outbreak, spreading disease cubes even further. Outbreaks additionally increase the panic level of a city, making that city more expensive to travel to. \r\n Each month in the game, you have two chances to achieve that month's objectives. If you succeed, you win and immediately move on to the next month. If you fail, you have a second chance, with more funding for beneficial event cards. \r\n During the campaign, new rules and components will be introduced. These will sometimes require you to permanently alter the components of the game; this includes writing on cards, ripping up cards, and placing permanent stickers on components. Your characters can gain new skills, or detrimental effects. A character can even be lost entirely, at which point it's no longer available for play. "

      "description": "<p>2,000 years ago, the Roman Empire ruled the lands around the Mediterranean Sea. With peace at the borders, harmony inside the provinces, uniform law, and a common currency, the economy thrived and gave rise to mighty Roman dynasties as they expanded throughout the numerous cities. Guide one of these dynasties and send colonists to the remote realms of the Empire, develop your trade network, and appease the ancient gods to curry their favor - all to gain the chance to emerge victorious in Concordia.</p>",

With peace at the borders, harmony inside the provinces, uniform law, and a common currency, the economy thrived and gave rise to mighty Roman dynasties as they expanded throughout the numerous cities. Guide one of these dynasties and send colonists to the remote realms of the Empire, develop your trade network, and appease the ancient gods to curry their favor - all to gain the chance to emerge victorious in Concordia.

      "description": "<p>Within the charming valley of Everdell, beneath the boughs of towering trees, among meandering streams and mossy hollows, a civilization of forest critters is thriving and expanding. From Everfrost to Bellsong, many a year have come and gone, but the time has come for new territories to be settled and new cities established. You will be the leader of a group of critters intent on just such a task. There are buildings to construct, lively characters to meet, events to host - you have a busy year ahead of yourself. Will the sun shine brightest on your city before the winter moon rises? <br /><br />Everdell is a game of dynamic tableau building and worker placement.<br /><br />On their turn a player can take one of three actions:<br />a) Place a Worker: Each player has a collection of Worker pieces. These are placed on the board locations, events, and on Destination cards. Workers perform various actions to further the development of a player's tableau: gathering resources, drawing cards, and taking other special actions.<br />b) Play a Card: Each player is building and populating a city; a tableau of up to 15 Construction and Critter cards. There are five types of cards: Travelers, Production, Destination, Governance, and Prosperity. Cards generate resources (twigs, resin, pebbles, and berries), grant abilities, and ultimately score points. The interactions of the cards reveal numerous strategies and a near infinite variety of working cities.<br />c) Prepare for the next Season: Workers are returned to the players supply and new workers are added. The game is played from Winter through to the onset of the following winter, at which point the player with the city with the most points wins.</p>",

      "description_preview": " Within the charming valley of Everdell, beneath the boughs of towering trees, among meandering streams and mossy hollows, a civilization of forest critters is thriving and expanding. From Everfrost to Bellsong, many a year have come and gone, but the time has come for new territories to be settled and new cities established. You will be the leader of a group of critters intent on just such a task. There are buildings to construct, lively characters to meet, events to host - you have a busy year ahead of yourself. Will the sun shine brightest on your city before the winter moon rises?   Everdell is a game of dynamic tableau building and worker placement.  On their turn a player can take one of three actions: a) Place a Worker: Each player has a collection of Worker pieces. These are placed on the board locations, events, and on Destination cards. Workers perform various actions to further the development of a player's tableau: gathering resources, drawing cards, and taking other special actions. b) Play a Card: Each player is building and populating a city; a tableau of up to 15 Construction and Critter cards. There are five types of cards: Travelers, Production, Destination, Governance, and Prosperity. Cards generate resources (twigs, resin, pebbles, and berries), grant abilities, and ultimately score points. The interactions of the cards reveal numerous strategies and a near infinite variety of working cities. c) Prepare for the next Season: Workers are returned to the players supply and new workers are added. The game is played from Winter through to the onset of the following winter, at which point the player with the city with the most points wins. "

      "description": "<p>As a wealthy Renaissance merchant, acquire mines and transportation, hire artisans and woo the nobility. Create the most fantastic jewelry to become the best-known merchant of them all! Acquire precious stones to trade them for development cards. Use development cards to acquire more gem stones. Use your gems and gold to create the most fantastic jewelry, and appeal to the nobles to gain the prestige you need to win.<br /><br />Splendor is a fast-paced and addictive game of chip-collecting and card development. Players are merchants of the Renaissance trying to buy gem mines, means of transportation, shops; all in order to acquire the most prestige points. If you're wealthy enough, you might even receive a visit from a noble at some point, which of course will further increase your prestige.<br /><br />On your turn, you may (1) collect chips (gems), or (2) buy and build a card, or (3) reserve one card. If you collect chips, you take either three different kinds of chips or two chips of the same kind. If you buy a card, you pay its price in chips and add it to your playing area. To reserve a card, you place it in front of you face down for later building; this costs you a round, but you also get gold in the form of a joker chip, which you can use as any gem.<br /><br />All of the cards you buy increase your wealth as they give you a permanent gem bonus for later buys; some of the cards also give you prestige points. In order to win the game, you must reach 15 prestige points before your opponents do.</p>",

      "description_preview": " As a wealthy Renaissance merchant, acquire mines and transportation, hire artisans and woo the nobility. Create the most fantastic jewelry to become the best-known merchant of them all! Acquire precious stones to trade them for development cards. Use development cards to acquire more gem stones. Use your gems and gold to create the most fantastic jewelry, and appeal to the nobles to gain the prestige you need to win.  Splendor is a fast-paced and addictive game of chip-collecting and card development. Players are merchants of the Renaissance trying to buy gem mines, means of transportation, shops; all in order to acquire the most prestige points. If you're wealthy enough, you might even receive a visit from a noble at some point, which of course will further increase your prestige.  On your turn, you may (1) collect chips (gems), or (2) buy and build a card, or (3) reserve one card. If you collect chips, you take either three different kinds of chips or two chips of the same kind. If you buy a card, you pay its price in chips and add it to your playing area. To reserve a card, you place it in front of you face down for later building; this costs you a round, but you also get gold in the form of a joker chip, which you can use as any gem.  All of the cards you buy increase your wealth as they give you a permanent gem bonus for later buys; some of the cards also give you prestige points. In order to win the game, you must reach 15 prestige points before your opponents do. "

      "description": "<p><em><strong>Brass: Birmingham</strong></em> is an economic strategy game sequel to Martin Wallace's 2007 masterpiece, <em>Brass</em>. <em>Birmingham</em> tells the story of competing entrepreneurs in Birmingham during the industrial revolution, between the years of 1770-1870.</p>\r\n<p>As in its predecessor, you must develop, build, and establish your industries and network, in an effort to exploit low or high market demands.</p>\r\n<p>Each round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following actions (found in the original game):</p>\r\n<p>1) <strong>Build</strong> - Pay required resources and place an industry tile.<br />2) <strong>Network</strong> - Add a rail/canal link, expanding your network.<br />3) <strong>Develop</strong> - Increase the VP value of an industry.<br />4) <strong>Sell</strong> - Sell your cotton, manufactured goods and pottery.<br />5) <strong>Loan</strong> - Take a £30 loan and reduce your income.</p>\r\n<p><em>Brass: Birmingham</em> also features a new sixth action:</p>\r\n<p>6) <strong>Scout</strong> - Discard three cards and take a wild location and wild industry card. (This action replaces Double Action Build in original <em>Brass</em>.)</p>\r\n<p>The game is played over two halves: the canal era (years 1770-1830) and the rail era (years 1830-1870). To win the game, score the most VPs. VPs are counted at the end of each half for the canals, rails and established (flipped) industry tiles.</p>\r\n<p><em>Birmingham</em> features dynamic scoring canals/rails. Instead of each flipped industry tile giving a static 1 VP to all connected canals and rails, many industries give 0 or even 2 VPs. This provides players with the opportunity to score much higher value canals in the first era, and creates interesting strategy with industry placement.</p>\r\n<p>Iron, coal, and cotton are three industries which appear in both the original <em>Brass</em> as well as in <em>Brass: Birmingham</em>.</p>\r\n<p><strong>New &quot;Sell&quot; system</strong></p>\r\n<p>Brewing has become a fundamental part of the culture in Birmingham. You must now sell your product through traders located around the edges of the board. Each of these traders is looking for a specific type of good each game. To sell cotton, pottery, or manufactured goods to these traders, you must also &quot;grease the wheels of industry&quot; by consuming beer. For example, a level 1 cotton mill requires one beer to flip. As an incentive to sell early, the first player to sell to a trader receives free beer.</p>\r\n<p><em>Birmingham</em> features three all-new industry types:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Brewery</strong> - Produces precious beer barrels required to sell goods.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Manufactured goods</strong> - Function like cotton, but features eight levels. Each level of manufactured goods provides unique rewards, rather than just escalating in VPs, making it a more versatile (yet potentially more difficult) path vs cotton.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Pottery</strong> - These behemoths of Birmingham offer huge VPs, but at a huge cost and need to plan.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Increased Coal and Iron Market size</strong> - The price of coal and iron can now go up to £8 per cube, and it's not uncommon.</p>\r\n<p><em>Brass: Birmingham</em> is a sequel to Brass. It offers a very different story arc and experience from its predecessor.</p>",

      "description_preview": "   Brass: Birmingham   is an economic strategy game sequel to Martin Wallace's 2007 masterpiece,  Brass .  Birmingham  tells the story of competing entrepreneurs in Birmingham during the industrial revolution, between the years of 1770-1870. \r\n As in its predecessor, you must develop, build, and establish your industries and network, in an effort to exploit low or high market demands. \r\n Each round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following actions (found in the original game): \r\n 1)  Build  - Pay required resources and place an industry tile. 2)  Network  - Add a rail/canal link, expanding your network. 3)  Develop  - Increase the VP value of an industry. 4)  Sell  - Sell your cotton, manufactured goods and pottery. 5)  Loan  - Take a £30 loan and reduce your income. \r\n  Brass: Birmingham  also features a new sixth action: \r\n 6)  Scout  - Discard three cards and take a wild location and wild industry card. (This action replaces Double Action Build in original  Brass .) \r\n The game is played over two halves: the canal era (years 1770-1830) and the rail era (years 1830-1870). To win the game, score the most VPs. VPs are counted at the end of each half for the canals, rails and established (flipped) industry tiles. \r\n  Birmingham  features dynamic scoring canals/rails. Instead of each flipped industry tile giving a static 1 VP to all connected canals and rails, many industries give 0 or even 2 VPs. This provides players with the opportunity to score much higher value canals in the first era, and creates interesting strategy with industry placement. \r\n Iron, coal, and cotton are three industries which appear in both the original  Brass  as well as in  Brass: Birmingham . \r\n  New \"Sell\" system  \r\n Brewing has become a fundamental part of the culture in Birmingham. You must now sell your product through traders located around the edges of the board. Each of these traders is looking for a specific type of good each game. To sell cotton, pottery, or manufactured goods to these traders, you must also \"grease the wheels of industry\" by consuming beer. For example, a level 1 cotton mill requires one beer to flip. As an incentive to sell early, the first player to sell to a trader receives free beer. \r\n  Birmingham  features three all-new industry types: \r\n  Brewery  - Produces precious beer barrels required to sell goods. \r\n  Manufactured goods  - Function like cotton, but features eight levels. Each level of manufactured goods provides unique rewards, rather than just escalating in VPs, making it a more versatile (yet potentially more difficult) path vs cotton. \r\n  Pottery  - These behemoths of Birmingham offer huge VPs, but at a huge cost and need to plan. \r\n  Increased Coal and Iron Market size  - The price of coal and iron can now go up to £8 per cube, and it's not uncommon. \r\n  Brass: Birmingham  is a sequel to Brass. It offers a very different story arc and experience from its predecessor. "

      "description": "<p>The women and men of your expedition build the first two settlements. Fortunately, the land is rich in natural resources. You build roads and new settlements that eventually become cities. Will you succeed in gaining supremacy on Catan? Barter trade dominates the scene. Some resources you have in abundance, other resources are scarce. Ore for wool, brick for lumber - you trade according to what is needed for your current building projects. Proceed strategically! If you found your settlements in the right places and skillfully trade your resources, then the odds will be in your favor. But your opponents are smart too.</p>\r\n<p>To begin the game, we build the game board using hexagonal terrain tiles. Catan is born - a beautiful island with mountains, pastures, hills, fields, and forests, surrounded by the sea.</p>\r\n<p>Each of us places two small houses on spaces where three terrain hexes meet. They are our starting settlements.</p>\r\n<p>And so it begins. I roll two dice. An “11”! Each terrain hex is marked with a die roll number. Each player who owns a settlement adjacent to a terrain hex marked with the number rolled receives a resource produced by this hex. Hills produce brick, forests produce lumber, mountains produce ore, fields produce grain, and pastures produce wool.</p>\r\n<p>We use these resources to expand across Catan: we build roads and new settlements, or we upgrade our existing settlements to cities. For example, a road costs 1 brick and 1 lumber. If we do not have the necessary resources, we can acquire them by trading with our opponents.</p>\r\n<p>Each settlement is worth 1 victory point and each city is worth 2 victory points. If you expand cleverly, you may be the first player to reach 10 victory points and thus win the game!</p>",

      "description_preview": " The women and men of your expedition build the first two settlements. Fortunately, the land is rich in natural resources. You build roads and new settlements that eventually become cities. Will you succeed in gaining supremacy on Catan? Barter trade dominates the scene. Some resources you have in abundance, other resources are scarce. Ore for wool, brick for lumber - you trade according to what is needed for your current building projects. Proceed strategically! If you found your settlements in the right places and skillfully trade your resources, then the odds will be in your favor. But your opponents are smart too. \r\n To begin the game, we build the game board using hexagonal terrain tiles. Catan is born - a beautiful island with mountains, pastures, hills, fields, and forests, surrounded by the sea. \r\n Each of us places two small houses on spaces where three terrain hexes meet. They are our starting settlements. \r\n And so it begins. I roll two dice. An “11”! Each terrain hex is marked with a die roll number. Each player who owns a settlement adjacent to a terrain hex marked with the number rolled receives a resource produced by this hex. Hills produce brick, forests produce lumber, mountains produce ore, fields produce grain, and pastures produce wool. \r\n We use these resources to expand across Catan: we build roads and new settlements, or we upgrade our existing settlements to cities. For example, a road costs 1 brick and 1 lumber. If we do not have the necessary resources, we can acquire them by trading with our opponents. \r\n Each settlement is worth 1 victory point and each city is worth 2 victory points. If you expand cleverly, you may be the first player to reach 10 victory points and thus win the game! "

      "description": "<p>Patchwork is a form of needlework that involves sewing together pieces of fabric into a larger design. In the past, it was a way to make use of leftover pieces of cloth to create clothing and quilts. Today, patchwork is a form of art, in which the designers use precious fabrics to create beautiful textiles. The use of uneven pieces of fabric in particular can result in real masterpieces and is therefore being practiced by a large number of textile artists.<br /><br />To create a beautiful quilt, however, requires effort and time, but the available patches just do not want to fit together. So choose your patches carefully and keep a healthy supply of buttons to not only finish your quilt, but to make it better and more beautiful than your opponent's.</p>",

      "description_preview": " Patchwork is a form of needlework that involves sewing together pieces of fabric into a larger design. In the past, it was a way to make use of leftover pieces of cloth to create clothing and quilts. Today, patchwork is a form of art, in which the designers use precious fabrics to create beautiful textiles. The use of uneven pieces of fabric in particular can result in real masterpieces and is therefore being practiced by a large number of textile artists.  To create a beautiful quilt, however, requires effort and time, but the available patches just do not want to fit together. So choose your patches carefully and keep a healthy supply of buttons to not only finish your quilt, but to make it better and more beautiful than your opponent's. "

      "description": "<p>In Race for the Galaxy from Rio Grande Games, players build galactic civilizations using game cards that represent worlds or technical and social developments. Each round consists of one or more of five possible phases. In each round, each player secretly and simultaneously chooses one of seven different action cards and then reveals it. Only the selected phases occur. For these phases, every player performs the phasea€s action, while the selecting player(s) also get a bonus for that phase. For example, if at least one player chooses the Develop action, then the Develop phase will occur, otherwise it is skipped. In it, each player may simultaneously select a development from his hand of cards to build. After revealing the cards, each player adds his development to his tableau of cards on the table and then discards cards from his hand equal to its cost. Each player who chose Develop discards one card fewer as his bonus. Explore allows a player to draw cards and select which of them to add to his hand. Settle allows a player to place a world in his tableau. Some worlds produce goods, represented by face down cards, when Produce is selected. These goods can be discarded for victory points or sold to add cards to the player's hand by selecting Consume. With cards, players can settle new worlds and build more developments, gaining both victory points and card powers that provide advantages in certain phases. The player who best manages his cards, phase and bonus selections, and card powers to build the greatest space empire, wins. The winner is the player with the most victory points.</p>",

      "description_preview": " In Race for the Galaxy from Rio Grande Games, players build galactic civilizations using game cards that represent worlds or technical and social developments. Each round consists of one or more of five possible phases. In each round, each player secretly and simultaneously chooses one of seven different action cards and then reveals it. Only the selected phases occur. For these phases, every player performs the phasea€s action, while the selecting player(s) also get a bonus for that phase. For example, if at least one player chooses the Develop action, then the Develop phase will occur, otherwise it is skipped. In it, each player may simultaneously select a development from his hand of cards to build. After revealing the cards, each player adds his development to his tableau of cards on the table and then discards cards from his hand equal to its cost. Each player who chose Develop discards one card fewer as his bonus. Explore allows a player to draw cards and select which of them to add to his hand. Settle allows a player to place a world in his tableau. Some worlds produce goods, represented by face down cards, when Produce is selected. These goods can be discarded for victory points or sold to add cards to the player's hand by selecting Consume. With cards, players can settle new worlds and build more developments, gaining both victory points and card powers that provide advantages in certain phases. The player who best manages his cards, phase and bonus selections, and card powers to build the greatest space empire, wins. The winner is the player with the most victory points. "

      "description": "<div>\r\n<p>This ain't your average, everyday Euro game! Welcome to the Great Western Trail, where players take on the role of cattle drivers attempting to wrangle their herd to market. The trail will be tough, and countless hazards await you. Can you make it to the end of your journey and turn a tidy profit? Find out in Great Western Trail!<br /><br /><strong>Simple Mechanics, Complex Decisions</strong><br />Turns in Great Western Trail are broken into three simple phases that will carry you through the entire game. These simple phases belie a web of deep and complex decisions players will face as they make their way down the trail. The mechanics are simple, but mastering the trail is where the fun lies.<br /><br /><strong>Make Your Move!</strong><br />A turn starts by moving your cattleman down the trail. The number of spaces a player is allowed to move is dictated by their player board, and there are hazards a plenty all along the trail. Wherever you end up, the next phase is ...<br /><br /><strong>Take Action!</strong><br />When a player ends their movement, they perform the action listed on the space they ended on. Depending on where you land, you will have different options available to you. Neutral locations or buildings you own will allow you to perform a special action specific to that location or a single auxiliary action. On locations owned by other players, hazard tiles, or teepee tiles, your only option is to use an auxiliary action. Last, there's Kansas City!<br /><br /><strong>Kansas City or Bust!</strong><br />Landing on Kansas City sets off a series of subphases that must be resolved in order: Three Foresight phases, the Income Phase, and the Delivery Phase. The Foresight subphases give players a choice between two tiles to add to the board (hazard, teepee, or worker). These tiles will affect future trips down the trail, so choose wisely. Earn income from your journey down the trail by revealing and discarding your hand. Finally, choose a city to deliver your cattle to. This leg of your journey is over. Now it's time to do it all again!<br /><br /><strong>Draw!</strong><br />Draw up to your hand limit and your turn is over! Time to start planning your next move and figure out the choices you'll face in the coming turns.</p>\r\n</div>",

      "description_preview": " \r\n This ain't your average, everyday Euro game! Welcome to the Great Western Trail, where players take on the role of cattle drivers attempting to wrangle their herd to market. The trail will be tough, and countless hazards await you. Can you make it to the end of your journey and turn a tidy profit? Find out in Great Western Trail!   Simple Mechanics, Complex Decisions  Turns in Great Western Trail are broken into three simple phases that will carry you through the entire game. These simple phases belie a web of deep and complex decisions players will face as they make their way down the trail. The mechanics are simple, but mastering the trail is where the fun lies.   Make Your Move!  A turn starts by moving your cattleman down the trail. The number of spaces a player is allowed to move is dictated by their player board, and there are hazards a plenty all along the trail. Wherever you end up, the next phase is ...   Take Action!  When a player ends their movement, they perform the action listed on the space they ended on. Depending on where you land, you will have different options available to you. Neutral locations or buildings you own will allow you to perform a special action specific to that location or a single auxiliary action. On locations owned by other players, hazard tiles, or teepee tiles, your only option is to use an auxiliary action. Last, there's Kansas City!   Kansas City or Bust!  Landing on Kansas City sets off a series of subphases that must be resolved in order: Three Foresight phases, the Income Phase, and the Delivery Phase. The Foresight subphases give players a choice between two tiles to add to the board (hazard, teepee, or worker). These tiles will affect future trips down the trail, so choose wisely. Earn income from your journey down the trail by revealing and discarding your hand. Finally, choose a city to deliver your cattle to. This leg of your journey is over. Now it's time to do it all again!   Draw!  Draw up to your hand limit and your turn is over! Time to start planning your next move and figure out the choices you'll face in the coming turns. \r\n "

Each turn you will connect a new domino to your existing kingdom, making sure that at least one of its sides connects to a matching element already in play.<br /><br />Make sure to include dominoes with crowns on them, because at the end of the game you will score points equal to the total number of matching elements multiplied by the number of crowns.</p>\r\n<p>In the Giant edition, each domino is 3.12 x 6.25 inches and each wooden king meeple is 2 inches tall! </p>",

Each turn you will connect a new domino to your existing kingdom, making sure that at least one of its sides connects to a matching element already in play.  Make sure to include dominoes with crowns on them, because at the end of the game you will score points equal to the total number of matching elements multiplied by the number of crowns. \r\n In the Giant edition, each domino is 3.12 x 6.25 inches and each wooden king meeple is 2 inches tall!  "

Unfortunately, she has locked herself in the Palace, and you must rely on others to bring your romantic letters to her. Will yours reach her first?</p>\r\n<p><strong>Love Letter</strong> is a game of risk, deduction, and luck for 2 to 4 players. Your goal is to get your love letter into Princess Annette's hands while deflecting the letters from competing suitors. From a deck with only sixteen cards, each player starts with only one card in hand; one card is removed from play. On a turn, you draw one card, and play one card, trying to expose others and knock them from the game. Powerful cards lead to early gains, but make you a target. Rely on weaker cards for too long, however, and your letter may be tossed in the fire.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Munchkin Loot Letter:</strong></em></p>\r\n<p>Steal the treasure and backstab your friends - without all of the silly card-playing stuff. Well, without some of it.

A vision of loveliness and poise, Iweko Miaka’s position of princess in the Imperial family ensures her betrothal will be a great contest for the samurai clans of the Emerald Empire. Whichever clan can win her as a wife for one of their young samurai will secure standing and glory for decades to come. And though the marriage may be political, what better way to influence the decision than by winning the heart of the princess herself?</p>\r\n<p><strong>Letters to Santa:</strong></p>\r\n<p>If you want all of your Christmas wishes brought by the big guy, you’ll need to make sure your letter makes it to him.

      "description_preview": " All of the eligible young men (and many of the not-so-young) seek to woo the princess of Tempest. Unfortunately, she has locked herself in the Palace, and you must rely on others to bring your romantic letters to her. Will yours reach her first? \r\n  Love Letter  is a game of risk, deduction, and luck for 2 to 4 players. Your goal is to get your love letter into Princess Annette's hands while deflecting the letters from competing suitors. From a deck with only sixteen cards, each player starts with only one card in hand; one card is removed from play. On a turn, you draw one card, and play one card, trying to expose others and knock them from the game. Powerful cards lead to early gains, but make you a target. Rely on weaker cards for too long, however, and your letter may be tossed in the fire. \r\n   Munchkin Loot Letter:   \r\n Steal the treasure and backstab your friends - without all of the silly card-playing stuff. Well, without some of it. OK, without all but 16 cards of it, at least.  Munchkin Loot Letter  is a game of risk, deduction, and luck for 2-4 players. \r\n   Love Letter: Legend of the Five Rings:   \r\n Love and Honor. A vision of loveliness and poise, Iweko Miaka’s position of princess in the Imperial family ensures her betrothal will be a great contest for the samurai clans of the Emerald Empire. Whichever clan can win her as a wife for one of their young samurai will secure standing and glory for decades to come. And though the marriage may be political, what better way to influence the decision than by winning the heart of the princess herself? \r\n  Letters to Santa:  \r\n If you want all of your Christmas wishes brought by the big guy, you’ll need to make sure your letter makes it to him. The closer you get the letter to Santa, the more likely you are to win! But watch out for the wily Krampus, out to dash your yuletide dreams! \r\n  Letters to Santa  is a game of risk, deduction, and luck for 2–4 players. Your goal is to get your letter into Santa's hands while deflecting the letters from others.

      "description": "<p>Prospector, captain, mayor, trader, settler, craftsman, or builder? Which roles will you play in the new world? Will you own the most prosperous plantations? Will you build the most valuable buildings? You have but one goal: achieve the greatest prosperity and highest respect! This is shown by the player who earns the most victory points. He will win the game!</p>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p>In Puerto Rico, players assume the roles of colonial governors on the island of Puerto Rico. The aim of the game is to amass victory points by shipping goods to Europe or by constructing buildings.</p>\r\n<p>Each player uses a separate small board with spaces for city buildings, plantations, and resources. Shared between the players are three ships, a trading house, and a supply of resources and doubloons.</p>\r\n<p>The resource cycle of the game is that players grow crops which they exchange for points or doubloons. Doubloons can then be used to buy buildings, which allow players to produce more crops or give them other abilities. Buildings and plantations do not work unless they are manned by colonists.</p>\r\n<p>During each round, players take turns selecting a role card from those on the table (such as &quot;Trader&quot; or &quot;Builder&quot;). When a role is chosen, every player gets to take the action appropriate to that role. The player that selected the role also receives a small privilege for doing so - for example, choosing the &quot;Builder&quot; role allows all players to construct a building, but the player who chose the role may do so at a discount on that turn. Unused roles gain a doubloon bonus at the end of each turn, so the next player who chooses that role gets to keep any doubloon bonus associated with it. This encourages players to make use of all the roles throughout a typical course of a game.</p>\r\n<p>Puerto Rico uses a variable phase order mechanism in which a &quot;governor&quot; token is passed clockwise to the next player at the conclusion of a turn. The player with the token begins the round by choosing a role and taking the first action.</p>\r\n<p>Players earn victory points for owning buildings, for shipping goods, and for manned &quot;large buildings.&quot; Each player's accumulated shipping chips are kept face down and come in denominations of one or five. This prevents other players from being able to determine the exact score of another player. Goods and doubloons are placed in clear view of other players and the totals of each can always be requested by a player. As the game enters its later stages, the unknown quantity of shipping tokens and its denominations require players to consider their options before choosing a role that can end the game.</p>\r\n<p>In 2011 and mostly afterwards, Puerto Rico was published to include both Puerto Rico: Expansion I – New Buildings and Puerto Rico: Expansion II – The Nobles. These versions are included in the other game entry Puerto Rico (with two expansions), not this regular game entry for Puerto Rico. Some editions of Puerto Rico list the player count as 2-5 instead of 3-5, and they include variant rules for games with only two players.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>0 Links</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>",

      "description_preview": " Prospector, captain, mayor, trader, settler, craftsman, or builder? Which roles will you play in the new world? Will you own the most prosperous plantations? Will you build the most valuable buildings? You have but one goal: achieve the greatest prosperity and highest respect! This is shown by the player who earns the most victory points. He will win the game! \r\n \r\n \r\n In Puerto Rico, players assume the roles of colonial governors on the island of Puerto Rico. The aim of the game is to amass victory points by shipping goods to Europe or by constructing buildings. \r\n Each player uses a separate small board with spaces for city buildings, plantations, and resources. Shared between the players are three ships, a trading house, and a supply of resources and doubloons. \r\n The resource cycle of the game is that players grow crops which they exchange for points or doubloons. Doubloons can then be used to buy buildings, which allow players to produce more crops or give them other abilities. Buildings and plantations do not work unless they are manned by colonists. \r\n During each round, players take turns selecting a role card from those on the table (such as \"Trader\" or \"Builder\"). When a role is chosen, every player gets to take the action appropriate to that role. The player that selected the role also receives a small privilege for doing so - for example, choosing the \"Builder\" role allows all players to construct a building, but the player who chose the role may do so at a discount on that turn. Unused roles gain a doubloon bonus at the end of each turn, so the next player who chooses that role gets to keep any doubloon bonus associated with it. This encourages players to make use of all the roles throughout a typical course of a game. \r\n Puerto Rico uses a variable phase order mechanism in which a \"governor\" token is passed clockwise to the next player at the conclusion of a turn. The player with the token begins the round by choosing a role and taking the first action. \r\n Players earn victory points for owning buildings, for shipping goods, and for manned \"large buildings.\" Each player's accumulated shipping chips are kept face down and come in denominations of one or five. This prevents other players from being able to determine the exact score of another player. Goods and doubloons are placed in clear view of other players and the totals of each can always be requested by a player. As the game enters its later stages, the unknown quantity of shipping tokens and its denominations require players to consider their options before choosing a role that can end the game. \r\n In 2011 and mostly afterwards, Puerto Rico was published to include both Puerto Rico: Expansion I – New Buildings and Puerto Rico: Expansion II – The Nobles. These versions are included in the other game entry Puerto Rico (with two expansions), not this regular game entry for Puerto Rico. Some editions of Puerto Rico list the player count as 2-5 instead of 3-5, and they include variant rules for games with only two players. \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n 0 Links \r\n \r\n "

      "description": "<p>In Blood Rage, each player controls their own Viking clan's warriors, leader, and ship. Ragnarok has come, and it's the end of the world! It's the Vikings' last chance to go down in a blaze of glory and secure their place in Valhalla at Odin's side! For a Viking there are many pathways to glory. You can invade and pillage the land for its rewards, crush your opponents in epic battles, fulfil quests, increase your clan's stats, or even die gloriously either in battle or from Ragnarok, the ultimate inescapable doom. Most player strategies are guided by the cards drafted at the beginning of each of the three game rounds (or Ages). These &quot;Gods' Gifts&quot; grant you numerous boons for your clan including: increased Viking strength and devious battle strategies, upgrades to your clan, or even the aid of legendary creatures from Norse mythology. They may also include various quests, from dominating specific provinces, to having lots of your Vikings sent to Valhalla. Most of these cards are aligned with one of the Norse gods, hinting at the kind of strategy they support. For example, Thor gives more glory for victory in battle, Heimdall grants you foresight and surprises, Tyr strengthens you in battle, while the trickster Loki actually rewards you for losing battles, or punishes the winner. Players must choose their strategies carefully during the draft phase, but also be ready to adapt and react to their opponents' strategies as the action phase unfolds. Battles are decided not only by the strength of the figures involved, but also by cards played in secret. By observing your opponents' actions and allegiances to specific gods, you may predict what card they are likely to play, and plan accordingly. Winning battles is not always the best course of action, as the right card can get you even more rewards by being crushed. The only losing strategy in Blood Rage is to shy away from battle and a glorious death!</p>",

You need followers and their abilities to expand your dominance by putting them to work as traders, builders, and scientists. Knights expand your scope of action and secure your mercantile expeditions. Craftsmen build trading stations and tools to facilitate work. Scholars make progress in science, and last but not least it cannot hurt to get active in monasteries since with monks on your side you are much less likely to fall prey to fate. \r\n In   Orléans  , you will always want to take more actions than possible, and there are many paths to victory. The challenge is to combine all elements as best as possible with regard to your strategy. \r\n \r\n\r\n "

      "description": "<p>Clans of Caledonia is a mid-to-heavy economic game set in 19th-century Scotland. At this time, Scotland made the transition from an agricultural to an industrialized country that heavily relied on trade and export. In the following years, food production increased significantly to feed the population growth. Linen was increasingly substituted by the cheaper cotton and raising sheep was given high importance. More and more distilleries were founded and whisky became the premium alcoholic beverage in Europe. Players represent historic clans with unique abilities and compete to produce, trade and export agricultural goods and of course whisky! The game comes with nine different clans, a modular board with 16 configurations, nine port bonuses and nine round scoring tiles.</p>",

      "description_preview": " Clans of Caledonia is a mid-to-heavy economic game set in 19th-century Scotland. At this time, Scotland made the transition from an agricultural to an industrialized country that heavily relied on trade and export. In the following years, food production increased significantly to feed the population growth. Linen was increasingly substituted by the cheaper cotton and raising sheep was given high importance. More and more distilleries were founded and whisky became the premium alcoholic beverage in Europe. Players represent historic clans with unique abilities and compete to produce, trade and export agricultural goods and of course whisky! The game comes with nine different clans, a modular board with 16 configurations, nine port bonuses and nine round scoring tiles. "

      "description": "<p>The Maya were a highly developed civilization known for its unique art, complex architecture, sophisticated mathematics and advanced knowledge of the stars. At the heart of their society was a mysterious calendar - Tzolk'in. With a length of 260 days, it could predict the right time to plant seeds, the time to build monuments, the day a new baby would be born as well as the movement of the planets. It was the centerpiece of the Mayan cycle of life.<br /><br />We invite you to become one of the ajaw, the leaders of Mayan tribes. Please the gods and lead your clan to prosperity!<br /><br />As in the life of ancient Maya, the center of our game is the Tzolk'in calendar - a set of gears that rotate each round of the game. This unique system helps you to visualize the cyclic flow of time and plan your actions in advance. Harvest crops now, or wait for them to grow a little more for higher yield? All will be clear to see on the wheels of time.</p>",

      "description_preview": " The Maya were a highly developed civilization known for its unique art, complex architecture, sophisticated mathematics and advanced knowledge of the stars. At the heart of their society was a mysterious calendar - Tzolk'in. With a length of 260 days, it could predict the right time to plant seeds, the time to build monuments, the day a new baby would be born as well as the movement of the planets. It was the centerpiece of the Mayan cycle of life.  We invite you to become one of the ajaw, the leaders of Mayan tribes. Please the gods and lead your clan to prosperity!  As in the life of ancient Maya, the center of our game is the Tzolk'in calendar - a set of gears that rotate each round of the game. This unique system helps you to visualize the cyclic flow of time and plan your actions in advance. Harvest crops now, or wait for them to grow a little more for higher yield? All will be clear to see on the wheels of time. "

      "description": "<p>Power Grid is the updated release of the Friedemann Friese crayon game Funkenschlag. The latest cooperative publishing effort from Friedemann Friese and Rio Grande Games, removes the crayon aspect from network building in the original editionwhile retaining the fluctuating commodities market like McMulti and an auction round intensity reminiscent of The Princes of Florence.<br /><br />The object of Power Grid is to supply the most cities with power when someone's network gains a predetermined size. In this new edition, players mark preexisting routes between cities for connection, and then vie against other players to purchase the power plants that you use to supply the power. However, as plants are purchased, newer more efficient plants become available so you?re potentially allowing others to access to superior equipment merely by purchasing at all. <br /><br />Additionally, players must acquire the raw materials, like coal, oil, garbage, or uranium, to power said plants (except for the highly valuable renewable energy wind/solar plants), making it a constant struggle to upgrade your plants for maximum efficiency while still retaining enough wealth to quickly expand your network to get the cheapest routes.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Power Grid: Recharged Edition</strong> will replace Power Grid. Small but meaningful improvements have been made to the game including updated rules to improve game play, an updated player order tracker, new reference cards, and a discount token to enhance power plant auctions. Power Grid: Recharged Edition will be compatible with all previous Power Grid expansions.</p>",

      "description_preview": " Power Grid is the updated release of the Friedemann Friese crayon game Funkenschlag. The latest cooperative publishing effort from Friedemann Friese and Rio Grande Games, removes the crayon aspect from network building in the original editionwhile retaining the fluctuating commodities market like McMulti and an auction round intensity reminiscent of The Princes of Florence.  The object of Power Grid is to supply the most cities with power when someone's network gains a predetermined size. In this new edition, players mark preexisting routes between cities for connection, and then vie against other players to purchase the power plants that you use to supply the power. However, as plants are purchased, newer more efficient plants become available so you?re potentially allowing others to access to superior equipment merely by purchasing at all.   Additionally, players must acquire the raw materials, like coal, oil, garbage, or uranium, to power said plants (except for the highly valuable renewable energy wind/solar plants), making it a constant struggle to upgrade your plants for maximum efficiency while still retaining enough wealth to quickly expand your network to get the cheapest routes. \r\n  Power Grid: Recharged Edition  will replace Power Grid. Small but meaningful improvements have been made to the game including updated rules to improve game play, an updated player order tracker, new reference cards, and a discount token to enhance power plant auctions. Power Grid: Recharged Edition will be compatible with all previous Power Grid expansions. "

Each player leads a faction of survivors with dozens of different characters in the game.<br /><br />Dead of Winter is a meta-cooperative psychological survival game. This means players are working together toward one common victory condition--but for each individual player to achieve victory, they must also complete their personal secret objective. This secret objective could relate to a psychological tick that's fairly harmless to most others in the colony, a dangerous obsession that could put the main objective at risk, a desire for sabotage of the main mission, or worst of all: vengeance against the colony! Certain games could end with all players winning, some winning and some losing, or all players losing. Work toward the group's goal but don't get walked all over by a loudmouth who's only looking out for their own interests!</p>",

      "description_preview": " Dead of Winter puts 2-5 players together in a small, weakened colony of survivors in a world where most of humanity are either dead or diseased, flesh-craving monsters. Each player leads a faction of survivors with dozens of different characters in the game.  Dead of Winter is a meta-cooperative psychological survival game. This means players are working together toward one common victory condition--but for each individual player to achieve victory, they must also complete their personal secret objective. This secret objective could relate to a psychological tick that's fairly harmless to most others in the colony, a dangerous obsession that could put the main objective at risk, a desire for sabotage of the main mission, or worst of all: vengeance against the colony! Certain games could end with all players winning, some winning and some losing, or all players losing. Work toward the group's goal but don't get walked all over by a loudmouth who's only looking out for their own interests! "

      "description": "<p>In this fast-playing card game, the goal is to grab the best combination of sushi dishes as they whiz by. Score points for making the most maki rolls or for collecting a full set of sashimi. Dip your favorite nigiri in wasabi to triple its value! But be sure to leave room for dessert or else you'll eat into your score! Gather the most points and consider yourself the sushi master!</p>\r\n<p><em>Sushi Go!</em> takes the card-drafting mechanism of <em>Fairy Tale</em> and <em>7 Wonders</em> and distills it into a twenty-minute game that anyone can play. The dynamics of &quot;draft and pass&quot; are brought to the fore, while keeping the rules to a minimum. As you see the first few hands of cards, you must quickly assess the make-up of the round and decide which type of sushi you'll go for. Then, each turn you'll need to weigh which cards to keep and which to pass on. The different scoring combinations allow for some clever plays and nasty blocks. Round to round, you must also keep your eye on the goal of having the most pudding cards at the end of the game!</p>",

      "description_preview": " In this fast-playing card game, the goal is to grab the best combination of sushi dishes as they whiz by. Score points for making the most maki rolls or for collecting a full set of sashimi. Dip your favorite nigiri in wasabi to triple its value! But be sure to leave room for dessert or else you'll eat into your score! Gather the most points and consider yourself the sushi master! \r\n  Sushi Go!  takes the card-drafting mechanism of  Fairy Tale  and  7 Wonders  and distills it into a twenty-minute game that anyone can play. The dynamics of \"draft and pass\" are brought to the fore, while keeping the rules to a minimum. As you see the first few hands of cards, you must quickly assess the make-up of the round and decide which type of sushi you'll go for. Then, each turn you'll need to weigh which cards to keep and which to pass on. The different scoring combinations allow for some clever plays and nasty blocks. Round to round, you must also keep your eye on the goal of having the most pudding cards at the end of the game! "

      "description": "<p><b>Ticket to Ride: Europe</b> takes you on a new train adventure across Europe. From Edinburgh to Constantinople and from Lisbon to Moscow, you'll visit great cities of turn-of-the-century Europe. Like the original Ticket to Ride, the game remains elegantly simple, can be learned in 5 minutes, and appeals to both families and experienced gamers. </p><p>Ticket to Ride: Europe is a complete and does not require the original version. More than just a new map, Ticket to Ride: Europe features brand new gameplay elements. Tunnels may require you to pay extra cards to build on them, Ferries require locomotive cards in order to claim them, and Stations allow you to sacrifice a few points in order to use an opponents route to connect yours. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game also includes larger format cards and Train Station game pieces. The overall goal remains the same, collect and play train cards in order to place your pieces on the board, attempting to connect cities on your ticket cards. Points are earned both from placing trains and completing tickets but uncompleted tickets lose you points. The player who has the most points at the end of the game wins.</p><p>-International Gamers Award 2005<br /></p>",

      "description_preview": "  Ticket to Ride: Europe  takes you on a new train adventure across Europe. From Edinburgh to Constantinople and from Lisbon to Moscow, you'll visit great cities of turn-of-the-century Europe. Like the original Ticket to Ride, the game remains elegantly simple, can be learned in 5 minutes, and appeals to both families and experienced gamers.   Ticket to Ride: Europe is a complete and does not require the original version. More than just a new map, Ticket to Ride: Europe features brand new gameplay elements. Tunnels may require you to pay extra cards to build on them, Ferries require locomotive cards in order to claim them, and Stations allow you to sacrifice a few points in order to use an opponents route to connect yours.  \r\n \r\nThe game also includes larger format cards and Train Station game pieces. The overall goal remains the same, collect and play train cards in order to place your pieces on the board, attempting to connect cities on your ticket cards. Points are earned both from placing trains and completing tickets but uncompleted tickets lose you points. The player who has the most points at the end of the game wins.  -International Gamers Award 2005  "

You will have to find food, fight wild beasts, protect yourself from weather changes… \r\n Take the role of one of four characters from the ship crew (cook, carpenter, explorer or soldier) and face the adventure. Use your determination skills to help your team mates, discuss with them your plan and put it into practice. Debate, discuss, and work on the best plan you all can make. \r\n Search for treasures. Discover mysteries. Follow goals of six different, engaging scenarios. Start by building a big pile of wood and setting it on fire to call for help, and then start new adventures. Become an exorcist on cursed Island. Become a treasure hunter on Volcano Island. Become a rescue team for a young lady who’s stuck on rock island… \r\n In the 2016 edition players will find custom wooden pieced for all resources, thick cardboard player boards for each character, additional 7th scenario and what's most important, a completely rewritten rulebook.

As the cards are played, the expedition routes take shape and the explorers earn points. The most daring adventurers make bets on the success of their expeditions. The explorer with the highest score after three rounds of expeditions wins. The rules of the game are simple, but beware: The lost cities hold many unseen mysteries!</p>\r\n<p>Note: The 2019 edition came with a double sided game board and The Lost Expedition mini-expansion.</p>",

Two explorers embark on research journeys to remote corners of the world: the Himalayan mountains, the Central American rainforest, the Egyptian desert, a mysterious volcano, and the bottom of the sea. As the cards are played, the expedition routes take shape and the explorers earn points. The most daring adventurers make bets on the success of their expeditions. The explorer with the highest score after three rounds of expeditions wins. The rules of the game are simple, but beware: The lost cities hold many unseen mysteries! \r\n Note: The 2019 edition came with a double sided game board and The Lost Expedition mini-expansion. "

      "description": "<p>&quot;Star Wars: Rebellion is a board game of epic conflict between the Galactic Empire and Rebel Alliance for two to four players! Experience the Galactic Civil War like never before. In Rebellion, you control the entire Galactic Empire or the fledgling Rebel Alliance. You must command starships, account for troop movements, and rally systems to your cause. Featuring more than 150 plastic miniatures and two game boards that account for thirty-two of the Star Wars galaxy's most notable systems, Rebellion features a scope that is as large and sweeping as any Star Wars game before it. Yet for all its grandiosity, Rebellion remains intensely personal, cinematic, and heroic. As much as your success depends upon the strength of your starships, vehicles, and troops, it depends upon the individual efforts of such notable characters as Leia Organa, Mon Mothma, Grand Moff Tarkin, and Emperor Palpatine. As civil war spreads throughout the galaxy, these leaders are invaluable to your efforts, and the secret missions they attempt will evoke many of the most inspiring moments from the classic trilogy. You might send Luke Skywalker to receive Jedi training on Dagobah or have Darth Vader spring a trap that freezes Han Solo in carbonite! Contents include: 1 game board (split in 2 halves), 170 plastic miniatures, 25 leaders (with stands), 10 custom dice, Over 170 cards, 1 Learn to Play Booklet, 1 Rules Reference&quot;.</p>",

      "description_preview": " \"Star Wars: Rebellion is a board game of epic conflict between the Galactic Empire and Rebel Alliance for two to four players! Experience the Galactic Civil War like never before. In Rebellion, you control the entire Galactic Empire or the fledgling Rebel Alliance. You must command starships, account for troop movements, and rally systems to your cause. Featuring more than 150 plastic miniatures and two game boards that account for thirty-two of the Star Wars galaxy's most notable systems, Rebellion features a scope that is as large and sweeping as any Star Wars game before it. Yet for all its grandiosity, Rebellion remains intensely personal, cinematic, and heroic. As much as your success depends upon the strength of your starships, vehicles, and troops, it depends upon the individual efforts of such notable characters as Leia Organa, Mon Mothma, Grand Moff Tarkin, and Emperor Palpatine. As civil war spreads throughout the galaxy, these leaders are invaluable to your efforts, and the secret missions they attempt will evoke many of the most inspiring moments from the classic trilogy. You might send Luke Skywalker to receive Jedi training on Dagobah or have Darth Vader spring a trap that freezes Han Solo in carbonite! Contents include: 1 game board (split in 2 halves), 170 plastic miniatures, 25 leaders (with stands), 10 custom dice, Over 170 cards, 1 Learn to Play Booklet, 1 Rules Reference\". "

You must construct sanctuaries for spiritual enlightenment, erect citadels to protect peaceful clans, and indulge your wanderlust by exploring the surrounding territories. As clans migrate throughout the land and come to coexist, their differences can lead to clashes, which are often resolved peacefully—but not always.</p>\r\n<p>Demonstrate your leadership by rallying clans loyal to your cause, and then the Great Council will have no choice but bestow the crown on you.</p>\r\n<p>The game's mechanics combine card drafting and area control to produce a system rich in strategic options and interpersonal interactions. The tiles give every game a unique, gradually unfolding geography. The art brings Ireland's ancient epics and audacious heroes to life.</p>\r\n<p>There are three different types of cards in <em>Inis</em>:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Action Cards - These are drafted each round and provide the base actions to deploy troops, move troops, attack, and play new regions.</li>\r\n<li>Advantage Cards - These are acquired as a result of controlling certain regions. Each region has its own Advantage Card you receive as a result of having the most troops in it.</li>\r\n<li>Epic Tales Cards - These unique and powerful cards evoke the Celtic gods and heroes to inspire the clans to accomplish legendary feats.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>",

      "description_preview": " \r\n In Inis, you play the role of a Celtic chieftain who has just arrived in a new land. You must construct sanctuaries for spiritual enlightenment, erect citadels to protect peaceful clans, and indulge your wanderlust by exploring the surrounding territories. As clans migrate throughout the land and come to coexist, their differences can lead to clashes, which are often resolved peacefully—but not always. \r\n Demonstrate your leadership by rallying clans loyal to your cause, and then the Great Council will have no choice but bestow the crown on you. \r\n The game's mechanics combine card drafting and area control to produce a system rich in strategic options and interpersonal interactions. The tiles give every game a unique, gradually unfolding geography. The art brings Ireland's ancient epics and audacious heroes to life. \r\n There are three different types of cards in  Inis : \r\n \r\n Action Cards - These are drafted each round and provide the base actions to deploy troops, move troops, attack, and play new regions. \r\n Advantage Cards - These are acquired as a result of controlling certain regions. Each region has its own Advantage Card you receive as a result of having the most troops in it. \r\n Epic Tales Cards - These unique and powerful cards evoke the Celtic gods and heroes to inspire the clans to accomplish legendary feats. \r\n \r\n "

Their greed and absolute control of the economy has reduced all but a privileged few to lives of poverty and desperation. Out of the oppressed masses rose The Resistance, an underground organization focused on overthrowing these powerful rulers. The valiant efforts of The Resistance have created discord, intrigue and weakness in the political courts of the novena royal, bringing the government to brink of collapse. But for you, a powerful government official, this is your opportunity to manipulate, bribe and bluff your way into absolute power. "

Their mission: to farm parcels of land, irrigate them, and have green, yellow or pink bamboo grow.</p>\r\n<p>In turn, they see what the weather brings and perform two actions from among those offered to them: get a new plot of land or irrigation channel, grow bamboo, feed the panda or draw an objective card.</p>\r\n<p>The game ends when a player has completed 7 to 9 objectives (depending on the number of players). The player who gets the best score by adding the total value of their completed objective wins the game.</p>\r\n<p>The <strong>Giant edition</strong> is the same game, in a super-sized format. Only 400 units were made available to the US market. The panda measures 4 3/8″ high and the gardener is 5 1/8&quot; high. Comes in a solid wooden box (12.4″ x 11.8″ x 10.2″).</p>\r\n<p><strong>Awards:</strong> 2012 Golden Geek Winner - Best Art and Presentation</p>",

Their mission: to farm parcels of land, irrigate them, and have green, yellow or pink bamboo grow. \r\n In turn, they see what the weather brings and perform two actions from among those offered to them: get a new plot of land or irrigation channel, grow bamboo, feed the panda or draw an objective card. \r\n The game ends when a player has completed 7 to 9 objectives (depending on the number of players). The player who gets the best score by adding the total value of their completed objective wins the game. \r\n The  Giant edition  is the same game, in a super-sized format. Only 400 units were made available to the US market. The panda measures 4 3/8″ high and the gardener is 5 1/8\" high. Comes in a solid wooden box (12.4″ x 11.8″ x 10.2″). \r\n  Awards:  2012 Golden Geek Winner - Best Art and Presentation "

      "description": "<p>The Empire must fall. Our mission must succeed. By destroying their key bases, we will shatter Imperial strength and liberate our people. Yet spies have infiltrated our ranks, ready for sabotage. We must unmask them. In five nights we reshape destiny or die trying. We are the Resistance!</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>The Resistance</strong></em> is a party game of social deduction. It is designed for five to ten players, lasts about 30 minutes, and has no player elimination. <em>The Resistance</em> is inspired by Mafia/Werewolf, yet it is unique in its core mechanics, which increase the resources for informed decisions, intensify player interaction, and eliminate player elimination.</p>\r\n<p>Players are either Resistance Operatives or Imperial Spies. For three to five rounds, they must depend on each other to carry out missions against the Empire. At the same time, they must try to deduce the other players’ identities and gain their trust. Each round begins with discussion. When ready, the Leader entrusts sets of Plans to a certain number of players (possibly including himself/herself). Everyone votes on whether or not to approve the assignment. Once an assignment passes, the chosen players secretly decide to Support or Sabotage the mission. Based on the results, the mission succeeds (Resistance win) or fails (Empire win). When a team wins three missions, they have won the game.</p>",

Yet spies have infiltrated our ranks, ready for sabotage. We must unmask them. In five nights we reshape destiny or die trying. We are the Resistance! \r\n   The Resistance   is a party game of social deduction. It is designed for five to ten players, lasts about 30 minutes, and has no player elimination.  The Resistance  is inspired by Mafia/Werewolf, yet it is unique in its core mechanics, which increase the resources for informed decisions, intensify player interaction, and eliminate player elimination. \r\n Players are either Resistance Operatives or Imperial Spies. For three to five rounds, they must depend on each other to carry out missions against the Empire. At the same time, they must try to deduce the other players’ identities and gain their trust. Each round begins with discussion. When ready, the Leader entrusts sets of Plans to a certain number of players (possibly including himself/herself). Everyone votes on whether or not to approve the assignment. Once an assignment passes, the chosen players secretly decide to Support or Sabotage the mission. Based on the results, the mission succeeds (Resistance win) or fails (Empire win). When a team wins three missions, they have won the game. "

      "description": "<p>Gear up for a thrilling adventure to recover a legendary flying machine buried deep in the ruins of an ancient desert city. You'll need to coordinate with your teammates and use every available resource if you hope to survive the scorching heat and relentless sandstorm. Find the flying machine and escape before you all become permanent artifacts of the Forbidden Desert! When we launched Forbidden Island in 2010, we had an inkling that we had created a hit game but never to the point that we'd be prompted to make a sequel. Well, here we are a few years later with just that in hand. Our challenge to designer Matt Leacock was to create a game that would contain familiar elements (cooperative play, modular board), while offering up a completely different in-game experience. In addition, we wanted it to be simultaneously approachable to new players while upping the ante for those who felt they had mastered Forbidden Island. All this resulted in a fresh new game with an innovative set of mechanics, such as an ever-shifting board, individual resource management, and unique method for locating the flying machine parts. Hopefully we've achieved our goals and quenched your thirst for adventure!</p>",

      "description_preview": " Gear up for a thrilling adventure to recover a legendary flying machine buried deep in the ruins of an ancient desert city. You'll need to coordinate with your teammates and use every available resource if you hope to survive the scorching heat and relentless sandstorm. Find the flying machine and escape before you all become permanent artifacts of the Forbidden Desert! When we launched Forbidden Island in 2010, we had an inkling that we had created a hit game but never to the point that we'd be prompted to make a sequel. Well, here we are a few years later with just that in hand. Our challenge to designer Matt Leacock was to create a game that would contain familiar elements (cooperative play, modular board), while offering up a completely different in-game experience. In addition, we wanted it to be simultaneously approachable to new players while upping the ante for those who felt they had mastered Forbidden Island. All this resulted in a fresh new game with an innovative set of mechanics, such as an ever-shifting board, individual resource management, and unique method for locating the flying machine parts. Hopefully we've achieved our goals and quenched your thirst for adventure! "

Good organization is key: wheelbarrows have to be filled with goods at the warehouses and then swiftly transported by the assistants to the various destinations. The goal of the merchants is to be the first to collect a certain amount of rubies.<br /><br />You are leading a merchant and four assistants through the 16 Places of the bazaar. At each Place, you can carry out a specific action. The challenge is that, to carry out an action at any of those Places, your merchant needs the help of an assistant and has to leave him behind. To use that assistant again later, your merchant has to come back to that Place and pick him up. So plan ahead carefully to avoid being left with no assistants and thus unable to do anything...</p>",

      "description_preview": " Hustle and bustle in the bazaar district of Istanbul: merchants and their assistants are hurrying through the narrow alleys attempting to be more successful than their competitors. Good organization is key: wheelbarrows have to be filled with goods at the warehouses and then swiftly transported by the assistants to the various destinations. The goal of the merchants is to be the first to collect a certain amount of rubies.  You are leading a merchant and four assistants through the 16 Places of the bazaar. At each Place, you can carry out a specific action. The challenge is that, to carry out an action at any of those Places, your merchant needs the help of an assistant and has to leave him behind. To use that assistant again later, your merchant has to come back to that Place and pick him up. So plan ahead carefully to avoid being left with no assistants and thus unable to do anything... "

A game for 1-4 players ages 12 and up; play time is 30 minutes per player. Amazing replay value. The Agricola base game is a revised edition of Uwe Rosenberg’s celebrated classic. The game is designed for 1-4 players, features improved all-wood components and a card selection from the base game as well as its expansions, revised and updated for this edition. Players begin the game with two family members and can grow their families over the course of the game. This allows them more actions but remember you have to grow more food to feed your family as it grows! Feeding your family is a special kind of challenge and players will plant grain and vegetables while supplementing their food supply with sheep, wild boar and cattle. Guide your family to wealth, health and prosperity and you will win the game.</p>",

      "description_preview": " Updated and streamlined for a new generation of players,  Agricola , the award-winning and highly acclaimed game by Uwe Rosenberg, features a revised rulebook and gameplay, along with wood pieces and components for up to four players. \r\n The 17th Century Was Not an Easy Time to be a Farmer. A game for 1-4 players ages 12 and up; play time is 30 minutes per player. Amazing replay value. The Agricola base game is a revised edition of Uwe Rosenberg’s celebrated classic. The game is designed for 1-4 players, features improved all-wood components and a card selection from the base game as well as its expansions, revised and updated for this edition. Players begin the game with two family members and can grow their families over the course of the game. This allows them more actions but remember you have to grow more food to feed your family as it grows! Feeding your family is a special kind of challenge and players will plant grain and vegetables while supplementing their food supply with sheep, wild boar and cattle. Guide your family to wealth, health and prosperity and you will win the game. "

You want a bigger and more pleasant kingdom, with more rivers and a wider variety of trees. You want a Dominion! <br /><br />In all directions lie fiefs, freeholds, and feodums. All are small bits of land, controlled by petty lords and verging on anarchy. You will bring civilization to these people, uniting them under your banner.</p>\r\n<p>In <em><strong>Dominion</strong></em>, each player starts with an identical, very small deck of cards. In the center of the table is a selection of other cards the players can &quot;buy&quot; as they can afford them. Through their selection of cards to buy, and how they play their hands as they draw them, the players construct their deck on the fly, striving for the most efficient path to the precious victory points by game end.</p>",

      "description_preview": " You are a monarch, like your parents before you, a ruler of a small pleasant kingdom of rivers and evergreens. Unlike your parents, however, you have hopes and dreams! You want a bigger and more pleasant kingdom, with more rivers and a wider variety of trees. You want a Dominion!   In all directions lie fiefs, freeholds, and feodums. All are small bits of land, controlled by petty lords and verging on anarchy. You will bring civilization to these people, uniting them under your banner. \r\n In   Dominion  , each player starts with an identical, very small deck of cards. In the center of the table is a selection of other cards the players can \"buy\" as they can afford them. Through their selection of cards to buy, and how they play their hands as they draw them, the players construct their deck on the fly, striving for the most efficient path to the precious victory points by game end.

The people are suffering - will you be their champion?<br /><br />Grey Fox Games is pleased to announce the release of Champions of Midgard - a Viking Era worker placement game with dice driven combat between players and mythical Norse beasts. The game has enjoyed much praise from playtesters and has received the Dice Tower Seal of Excellence!<br /><br />This newest release is Grey Fox Games' largest game yet with an impressive list of components including a 20&quot; x 30&quot; board, 34 custom dice, wooden meeples, carboard tokens, and 121 monster, draugr, and troll cards. In Champions of Midgard players assume the role of a Viking Leader attempting to earn the title of Jarl in a besieged harbor town. They will collect the weapons, wood, and food needed to build ships, carve runes and send their warriors across the sea to defeat the most savage beasts and earn the glory befitting a champion.<br /><br />&quot;The combat is what sets this game apart from other games in the genre,&quot; says Joshua Lobkowicz, Head of Game Development at Grey Fox Games. &quot;It's as approachable as Lords of Waterdeep but with the added thrill of rolling handfuls of Viking Warrior Dice in an attempt to kill awesome monsters.&quot;</p>",

      "description_preview": " Trolls attack your town. Draugr terrorize nearby villages. Monsters strike at travelers and merchants alike. The people are suffering - will you be their champion?  Grey Fox Games is pleased to announce the release of Champions of Midgard - a Viking Era worker placement game with dice driven combat between players and mythical Norse beasts. The game has enjoyed much praise from playtesters and has received the Dice Tower Seal of Excellence!  This newest release is Grey Fox Games' largest game yet with an impressive list of components including a 20\" x 30\" board, 34 custom dice, wooden meeples, carboard tokens, and 121 monster, draugr, and troll cards. In Champions of Midgard players assume the role of a Viking Leader attempting to earn the title of Jarl in a besieged harbor town. They will collect the weapons, wood, and food needed to build ships, carve runes and send their warriors across the sea to defeat the most savage beasts and earn the glory befitting a champion.  \"The combat is what sets this game apart from other games in the genre,\" says Joshua Lobkowicz, Head of Game Development at Grey Fox Games. \"It's as approachable as Lords of Waterdeep but with the added thrill of rolling handfuls of Viking Warrior Dice in an attempt to kill awesome monsters.\" "

On a turn, you get to take only two actions, one for you and one for the spouse, from all the possibilities you'll find on a farm: collecting clay, wood or stone; building fences; and so on. You might think about having kids in order to get more work accomplished, but first you need to expand your house. And what are you going to feed all the little rugrats?</p>\r\n<p>Agricola is a turn-based game. There are 14 game turns plus 6 harvest phases (after turn 4, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 14). Each player starts with two playing tokens (farmer and wife) and thus can take two actions per turn. There are multiple options, and while the game progresses, you'll have more and more: first thing in a turn, a new action card is flipped over. Problem: Each action can be taken just once per turn, so it's important to do some things with high preference. Each player also starts with a hand of 7 Occupation cards (of more than 160 total) and 7 Minor Improvement cards (of more than 140 total) that he may use during the game if they fit in his/her strategy. This amounts to countless strategies, some depending on your card hand. Sometimes it's a good choice to stay on course, sometimes you better react on what your opponents do.</p>",

But this is more difficult than expected in space. \r\n With each mission, the game becomes more difficult. After each mission, the game can be paused and continued later. During each mission, it is not the amount of tricks, but the right tricks at the right time that count. \r\n The team wins only if every single player is successful in fulfilling their tasks. \r\n The game comes with 50 missions. Three more missions were published in spielbox 2/2020 \r\n It is based on the mechanics of Tressette, that is a traditional Italian trick-taking card game. "

Each player commands a Group of worker dice which move around locations on a modular board. With each move a player relocates one worker to a new location, always choosing one of its two areas to perform an action (and upgrade their workforce), or a powerful bonus (but no upgrade). as the mysterious Twilight of teotihuacan approaches, players research technologies, raise the magnificent pyramid of the sun, build houses for the inhabitants of the city, collect precious masks, and climb the steps of three great temples to secure bonuses granted by the favour of the gods.</p>",

Each player commands a Group of worker dice which move around locations on a modular board. With each move a player relocates one worker to a new location, always choosing one of its two areas to perform an action (and upgrade their workforce), or a powerful bonus (but no upgrade). as the mysterious Twilight of teotihuacan approaches, players research technologies, raise the magnificent pyramid of the sun, build houses for the inhabitants of the city, collect precious masks, and climb the steps of three great temples to secure bonuses granted by the favour of the gods.

      "description": "<div>\r\n<p>Centuries ago, the spice trade was the most important market in the world. It established and destroyed empires, compelled men to explore the far corners of the earth, and led to the discovery of new worlds. At that time, the value of spices even rivaled that of gold! In the old days, they carried a sense of mystery and allure. Spice merchants would weave fantastic tales of danger to reach these spices in hopes of selling their wares at higher prices. In later centuries, the demand on spices became so great, that those who controlled the spices generated immense wealth and renown. It is at this time, you find yourself leading your caravan across the eastern lands to the Mediterranean Sea in search of wealth and fortune. As a caravan leader, your journey begins on the Spice Road. This is Century: Spice Road!<br /><br />In <strong>Century: Spice Road</strong>, players aim to collect and trade spices in order to acquire point cards and coins that are worth points at the end of the game. Players play cards from their hands to acquire spices for their caravan and trade those spices in for wealth and power (point cards and money), or to purchase new merchant cards to more efficiently acquire rare and valuable spices. Players take one action a turn until someone has acquired their fifth (or sixth in 2-3 player game) point card, players will finish out the current round of play and the person with the most points wins!<br /><br /><strong>Play or Acquire Cards</strong><br />At the start of the game, each player is given two merchant cards to start with and some preliminary spices. On their turn, each player may choose, as their action for the turn, to play a card from their hand, or spend spices to acquire a new merchant card from the row and place it in their hand. Merchant cards allow players to acquire new spices, exchange spices they currently have for different ones, or upgrade a spice to one worth more. Building up a good spice trading engine of merchant cards is an important part of succeeding on the Spice Road, so look out for powerful play sequences when taking new cards!<br /><br /><strong>Rest</strong><br />Once they've played all the cards from their hands, players must use their turn action to rest and return their cards to their hand. Now they'll be able to play their cards again on future turns, building up their caravan and further developing their hand of merchant cards to start acquiring point cards.<br /><br /><strong>Claim Point Cards</strong><br />The way to win in Century: Spice Road is to have the most points at the end of the game. Players get points when they acquire Point Cards and Coins by trading in their spices. Each point card in the row will have a different cost and overall point value listed on it, and the spice cost must be paid to acquire that card. If the two leftmost cards in the row are acquired, whoever acquired one of those point cards can take a coin from the pile above it. Silver coins are worth 1 point at the end of the game and gold coins are worth 3 points! Once a player has bought their fifth point card, the round of play finishes and a winner is crowned!</p>\r\n</div>",

      "description_preview": " \r\n Centuries ago, the spice trade was the most important market in the world. It established and destroyed empires, compelled men to explore the far corners of the earth, and led to the discovery of new worlds. At that time, the value of spices even rivaled that of gold! In the old days, they carried a sense of mystery and allure. Spice merchants would weave fantastic tales of danger to reach these spices in hopes of selling their wares at higher prices. In later centuries, the demand on spices became so great, that those who controlled the spices generated immense wealth and renown. It is at this time, you find yourself leading your caravan across the eastern lands to the Mediterranean Sea in search of wealth and fortune. As a caravan leader, your journey begins on the Spice Road. This is Century: Spice Road!  In  Century: Spice Road , players aim to collect and trade spices in order to acquire point cards and coins that are worth points at the end of the game. Players play cards from their hands to acquire spices for their caravan and trade those spices in for wealth and power (point cards and money), or to purchase new merchant cards to more efficiently acquire rare and valuable spices. Players take one action a turn until someone has acquired their fifth (or sixth in 2-3 player game) point card, players will finish out the current round of play and the person with the most points wins!   Play or Acquire Cards  At the start of the game, each player is given two merchant cards to start with and some preliminary spices. On their turn, each player may choose, as their action for the turn, to play a card from their hand, or spend spices to acquire a new merchant card from the row and place it in their hand. Merchant cards allow players to acquire new spices, exchange spices they currently have for different ones, or upgrade a spice to one worth more. Building up a good spice trading engine of merchant cards is an important part of succeeding on the Spice Road, so look out for powerful play sequences when taking new cards!   Rest  Once they've played all the cards from their hands, players must use their turn action to rest and return their cards to their hand. Now they'll be able to play their cards again on future turns, building up their caravan and further developing their hand of merchant cards to start acquiring point cards.   Claim Point Cards  The way to win in Century: Spice Road is to have the most points at the end of the game. Players get points when they acquire Point Cards and Coins by trading in their spices. Each point card in the row will have a different cost and overall point value listed on it, and the spice cost must be paid to acquire that card. If the two leftmost cards in the row are acquired, whoever acquired one of those point cards can take a coin from the pile above it. Silver coins are worth 1 point at the end of the game and gold coins are worth 3 points! Once a player has bought their fifth point card, the round of play finishes and a winner is crowned! \r\n "

Whether you have the first edition and its expansions or just one of the products, you can still incorporate it into your game. Each product you add to your collection will allow you to play as that game's investigators, introduce the possibility for those monsters to spawn, include a few new people to encounter, and widen the pool of maps the app could generate for your chosen scenario. If you decide to play without certain expansions or add more to your collection, you can always go back and change your collection within the app, thereby altering the possible combinations of monsters, maps, and investigators.</p>\r\n</div>",

      "description_preview": " \r\n Mansions of Madness: Second Edition is a fully co-operative, app-driven board game of horror and mystery for one to five players that takes place in the same universe as Eldritch Horror and Elder Sign.  \r\n The monster figures in   Mansions of Madness Second Edition   are set on the same bases as the Arkham Horror Premium Figures and those featured in the first edition of Mansions of Madness. These bases allow you to slide information tokens underneath them, so you have quick and easy access to the monsters' traits and abilities. Because of the consistency between editions, you can seamlessly incorporate your first edition and painted minis into your new game, expanding the possibilities of your game and further immersing you in the bone-chilling happenings that have befallen Arkham's residents. \r\n In the  Mansions of Madness Second Edition  companion app, you will have the option to incorporate some or all of your old components. Whether you have the first edition and its expansions or just one of the products, you can still incorporate it into your game. Each product you add to your collection will allow you to play as that game's investigators, introduce the possibility for those monsters to spawn, include a few new people to encounter, and widen the pool of maps the app could generate for your chosen scenario. If you decide to play without certain expansions or add more to your collection, you can always go back and change your collection within the app, thereby altering the possible combinations of monsters, maps, and investigators. \r\n "

      "description": "<p><em><strong>Paladins of the West Kingdom</strong></em> is set at a turbulent time of West Francia's story, circa 900 AD. Despite recent efforts to develop the city, outlying townships are still under threat from outsiders. Saracens scout the borders, while Vikings plunder wealth and livestock. Even the Byzantines from the east have shown their darker side.</p>\r\n<p>As noble men and women, players must gather workers from the city to defend against enemies, build fortifications and spread faith throughout the land. Fortunately you are not alone. In his great wisdom, the King has sent his finest knights to help aid in our efforts. So ready the horses and sharpen the swords. The Paladins are approaching.</p>\r\n<p>The aim of <em>Paladins of the West Kingdom</em> is to be the player with the most victory points (VP) at game's end. Points are gained by building outposts and fortifications, commissioning monks and confronting outsiders. Each round, players will enlist the help of a specific Paladin and gather workers to carry out tasks. As the game progresses, players will slowly increase their faith, strength and influence. Not only will these affect their final score, but they will also determine the significance of their actions. The game is concluded at the end of the seventh round.</p>",

      "description_preview": "   Paladins of the West Kingdom   is set at a turbulent time of West Francia's story, circa 900 AD. Despite recent efforts to develop the city, outlying townships are still under threat from outsiders. Saracens scout the borders, while Vikings plunder wealth and livestock. Even the Byzantines from the east have shown their darker side. \r\n As noble men and women, players must gather workers from the city to defend against enemies, build fortifications and spread faith throughout the land. Fortunately you are not alone. In his great wisdom, the King has sent his finest knights to help aid in our efforts. So ready the horses and sharpen the swords. The Paladins are approaching. \r\n The aim of  Paladins of the West Kingdom  is to be the player with the most victory points (VP) at game's end. Points are gained by building outposts and fortifications, commissioning monks and confronting outsiders. Each round, players will enlist the help of a specific Paladin and gather workers to carry out tasks. As the game progresses, players will slowly increase their faith, strength and influence. Not only will these affect their final score, but they will also determine the significance of their actions. The game is concluded at the end of the seventh round. "

      "description": "<p>Plan, build, and develop a small town into a major metropolis. Use hex-shaped building tiles to add residential, commercial, civic, and industrial areas, as well as special points of interest that provide benefits and take advantage of the resources of nearby towns. Your goal is to have your borough thrive and end up with a greater population than any of your opponents. <br /><br />Suburbia is a tile-laying game in which each player tries to build up an economic engine and infrastructure that will be initially self-sufficient, and eventually become both profitable and encourage population growth. As your town grows, you'll modify both your income and your reputation. As your income increases, you'll have more cash on hand to purchase better and more valuable buildings, such as an international airport or a high rise office building. As your reputation increases, you'll gain more and more population (and the winner at the end of the game is the player with the largest population).<br /><br />During each game, players compete for several unique goals that offer an additional population boost - and the buildings available in each game vary, so you'll never play the same game twice!</p>",

Use hex-shaped building tiles to add residential, commercial, civic, and industrial areas, as well as special points of interest that provide benefits and take advantage of the resources of nearby towns. Your goal is to have your borough thrive and end up with a greater population than any of your opponents.   Suburbia is a tile-laying game in which each player tries to build up an economic engine and infrastructure that will be initially self-sufficient, and eventually become both profitable and encourage population growth. As your town grows, you'll modify both your income and your reputation. As your income increases, you'll have more cash on hand to purchase better and more valuable buildings, such as an international airport or a high rise office building. As your reputation increases, you'll gain more and more population (and the winner at the end of the game is the player with the largest population).  During each game, players compete for several unique goals that offer an additional population boost - and the buildings available in each game vary, so you'll never play the same game twice! "

      "description": "<p><strong>Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion</strong> is a standalone game that takes place before the events of Gloomhaven. The game includes four new characters — Valrath Red Guard (tank, crowd control), Inox Hatchet (ranged damage), Human Voidwarden (support, mind-control), and Quatryl Demolitionist (melee damage, obstacle manipulation) — that can also be used in the original Gloomhaven game.</p>\r\n<p>The game also includes 16 monster types (including seven new standard monsters and three new bosses) and a new campaign with 25 scenarios that invites the heroes to investigate a case of mysterious disappearances within the city. Is it the work of Vermlings, or is something far more sinister going on?</p>\r\n<p>Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion is aimed at a more casual audience to get people into the gameplay more quickly. All of the hard-to-organize cardboard map tiles have been removed, and instead players will play on the scenario book itself, which features new artwork unique to each scenario. The last barrier to entry — i.e., learning the game — has also been lowered through a simplified rule set and a five-scenario tutorial that will ease new players into the experience.</p>",
      "commentary": "",
      "faq": "<h4>Frequently Asked Questions</h4>\r\n<p><strong>Is this compatible with the original Gloomhaven?</strong></p>\r\n<p>All<strong>&nbsp;</strong>new characters introduced in this game are fully compatible with Gloomhaven. Other elements such as new monsters and items cannot be carried over.</p>\r\n<p><strong>How many scenarios are in this game?</strong></p>\r\n<p>There are 25 scenarios, of which the first 5 are tutorials that will slowly get you up to speed on the rules. While it starts out slow, you'll find a noticeable step up in difficulty on scenario 4.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Can I play this solo?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Yes. In fact, many board gamers regard Gloomhaven as one of the top solo games out there. But beware that the solo rules require managing two characters. This may put off some solo gamers who feel like it's too much work, while others will enjoy the rich tactical decision-making and discovering the synergy between different classes.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Does this game require a Dungeon Master (DM)?</strong></p>\r\n<p>No, but if you'd like to try adding a DM for your group, then take a look at some of the suggestions on <a href=\"https://neuralnetgames.com/does-gloomhaven-have-a-dm/\">this article</a>. The DM could handle admin duties such as moving the monsters and keeping track of status effects, and help accentuate the theme with storytelling.</p>\r\n<p><strong style=\"font-size: 0.875rem;\">Should I play this before the original game?</strong></p>\r\n<p>If you're not ready to commit to a $100+ Gloomhaven purchase, go for Jaws of the Lion first. The rulebook \"hand holds\" you through the first five tutorial scenarios, and the scenario book drastically reduces setup and cleanup time by replacing the traditional map tiles. This solution was so well received by fans and reviewers that designer Isaac Childres is developing scenario books for <a class=\"game-preview\" href=\"/game/RLlDWHh7hR/gloomhaven\" data-tipped-options=\"ajax: {data: { ids: 'RLlDWHh7hR', client_id: 'W0AQGbjlZE' }}\">Gloomhaven</a>&nbsp;and <a class=\"game-preview\" href=\"/game/yTs3H7dTLM/frosthaven\" data-tipped-options=\"ajax: {data: { ids: 'yTs3H7dTLM', client_id: 'W0AQGbjlZE' }}\">Frosthaven</a>.</p>",

The game includes four new characters — Valrath Red Guard (tank, crowd control), Inox Hatchet (ranged damage), Human Voidwarden (support, mind-control), and Quatryl Demolitionist (melee damage, obstacle manipulation) — that can also be used in the original Gloomhaven game. \r\n The game also includes 16 monster types (including seven new standard monsters and three new bosses) and a new campaign with 25 scenarios that invites the heroes to investigate a case of mysterious disappearances within the city. Is it the work of Vermlings, or is something far more sinister going on? \r\n Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion is aimed at a more casual audience to get people into the gameplay more quickly. All of the hard-to-organize cardboard map tiles have been removed, and instead players will play on the scenario book itself, which features new artwork unique to each scenario. The last barrier to entry — i.e., learning the game — has also been lowered through a simplified rule set and a five-scenario tutorial that will ease new players into the experience. "

Step in and command your troops on the battlefields that defined History in the 20th century!</p>\r\n<p><strong>Memoir '44</strong> is a historical game where players command a horde of little plastic Army men facing-off in dozens of WWII battles on an oversize hex game board.</p>\r\n<p>Each battle scenario mimics the historical terrain, troop placements and objectives of each army. Deploying forces through a variety of Command cards, the smart commander uses the unique skills of his units -- infantry, paratroopers, tanks, artillery, commandos and resistance fighters -- to its greatest strength.</p>\r\n<p>Easy to learn and fast-paced, Memoir '44 requires strategic card play, timely dice rolling and an aggressive, yet flexible battle plan to achieve victory!</p>",

    "description_preview": " From the cliffs of Pointe-du-Hoc to the hedgerow battles in the Corentin Peninsula and beyond -- Memoir '44 airdrops you into the key battles that turned the tide in Western Europe during the summer of 1944. Omaha Beach, Pegasus Bridge, Operation Cobra... Step in and command your troops on the battlefields that defined History in the 20th century! \r\n  Memoir '44  is a historical game where players command a horde of little plastic Army men facing-off in dozens of WWII battles on an oversize hex game board. \r\n Each battle scenario mimics the historical terrain, troop placements and objectives of each army. Deploying forces through a variety of Command cards, the smart commander uses the unique skills of his units -- infantry, paratroopers, tanks, artillery, commandos and resistance fighters -- to its greatest strength. \r\n Easy to learn and fast-paced, Memoir '44 requires strategic card play, timely dice rolling and an aggressive, yet flexible battle plan to achieve victory!

Horse-drawn broughams, hansoms, and dog-carts rattle over the cobblestone streets, pulling their passengers through the pea-soup fog.

Still, even the most ingenious crime is only a puzzle for the world's only consulting detective—Sherlock Holmes!. "

    "description": "<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p>On the 11th of July, 1899 at 10 a.m., the Union Pacific Express has left Folsom, New Mexico, with 47 passengers on board. After a few minutes, gunfire and hurrying footsteps on the roof can be heard. Heavily armed bandits have come to rob honest citizens of their wallets and jewels. Will they succeed in stealing the suitcase holding the Nice Valley Coal Company's weekly pay, despite it having been placed under the supervision of Marshal Samuel Ford? Will these bandits hinder one another more than the Marshal since only the richest one of them can come out on top?</p>\r\n<p>In <em><strong>Colt Express</strong></em>, you play a bandit robbing a train at the same time as other bandits, and your goal is to become the richest outlaw of the Old West. The game consists of five rounds, and each round has two phases:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Phase 1: Schemin'</strong> Each player plays 2-5 action cards on a common pile, with the cards being face up or face down depending on the type of the round. Instead of playing a card, a player can draw three cards from her deck.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Phase 2: Stealin'</strong> The action cards are carried out in the order they were played, with a player's best laid plans possibly not panning out due to mistakes and oversights!</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The game takes place in a 3D train in which the bandits can move from one car to another, run on the roof, punch the other bandits, shoot them, rob the passengers, or draw the Marshal out of position. The train has as many cars as the number of players, and each car is seeded with gems, bags of loot or suitcases at the start of play.</p>\r\n<p>Each player starts a round with six cards in hand, with each card showing one of these actions. At the start of a round, a round card is revealed, showing how many cards will be played; whether they'll be played face up or face down, or individually or in pairs; and what action will occur at the end of the round (e.g., all bandits on top of the train move to the engine). You can pick up loot, gems or suitcases only by playing a &quot;steal&quot; card when you're in a train car that holds one of these items — but since everyone is planning to get these goods, you'll need to move, punch and shoot to get others out of your way. You can punch someone only in the same car as you, and when you do, the other bandit drops one of the goods he's collected and is knocked into an adjacent car.</p>\r\n<p>Each player's character has a special power, such as starting the round with an extra card, playing your first card face down, or pocketing a bag of loot when you punch someone instead of letting it hit the ground.</p>\r\n<p>You can shoot someone in an adjacent car or (if you're running on top of the train) anyone in sight, and when you do, you give that player one of your six bullet cards; that card gets shuffled in the opponent's deck, possibly giving her a dead card in hand on a future turn and forcing her to draw instead of playing something. If the Marshal ends up in the same car as you, likely due to other bandits luring him through the train, he'll be happy to give you a bullet, too.</p>\r\n<p>At the end of the game, whoever fired the most bullets receives a $1,000 braggart bonus, and whoever bagged the richest haul wins!</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p><strong><em>Nominated for the 2015 Spiel des Jahres award.</em></strong></p>",

    "description_preview": " \r\n \r\n On the 11th of July, 1899 at 10 a.m., the Union Pacific Express has left Folsom, New Mexico, with 47 passengers on board. After a few minutes, gunfire and hurrying footsteps on the roof can be heard. Heavily armed bandits have come to rob honest citizens of their wallets and jewels. Will they succeed in stealing the suitcase holding the Nice Valley Coal Company's weekly pay, despite it having been placed under the supervision of Marshal Samuel Ford? Will these bandits hinder one another more than the Marshal since only the richest one of them can come out on top? \r\n In   Colt Express  , you play a bandit robbing a train at the same time as other bandits, and your goal is to become the richest outlaw of the Old West. The game consists of five rounds, and each round has two phases: \r\n \r\n  Phase 1: Schemin'  Each player plays 2-5 action cards on a common pile, with the cards being face up or face down depending on the type of the round. Instead of playing a card, a player can draw three cards from her deck. \r\n  Phase 2: Stealin'  The action cards are carried out in the order they were played, with a player's best laid plans possibly not panning out due to mistakes and oversights! \r\n \r\n The game takes place in a 3D train in which the bandits can move from one car to another, run on the roof, punch the other bandits, shoot them, rob the passengers, or draw the Marshal out of position. The train has as many cars as the number of players, and each car is seeded with gems, bags of loot or suitcases at the start of play. \r\n Each player starts a round with six cards in hand, with each card showing one of these actions. At the start of a round, a round card is revealed, showing how many cards will be played; whether they'll be played face up or face down, or individually or in pairs; and what action will occur at the end of the round (e.g., all bandits on top of the train move to the engine). You can pick up loot, gems or suitcases only by playing a \"steal\" card when you're in a train car that holds one of these items — but since everyone is planning to get these goods, you'll need to move, punch and shoot to get others out of your way. You can punch someone only in the same car as you, and when you do, the other bandit drops one of the goods he's collected and is knocked into an adjacent car. \r\n Each player's character has a special power, such as starting the round with an extra card, playing your first card face down, or pocketing a bag of loot when you punch someone instead of letting it hit the ground. \r\n You can shoot someone in an adjacent car or (if you're running on top of the train) anyone in sight, and when you do, you give that player one of your six bullet cards; that card gets shuffled in the opponent's deck, possibly giving her a dead card in hand on a future turn and forcing her to draw instead of playing something. If the Marshal ends up in the same car as you, likely due to other bandits luring him through the train, he'll be happy to give you a bullet, too. \r\n At the end of the game, whoever fired the most bullets receives a $1,000 braggart bonus, and whoever bagged the richest haul wins! \r\n \r\n \r\n   Nominated for the 2015 Spiel des Jahres award.

    "description": "<p>Build your own Path without your opponents steering you in the wrong direction-or off the board! Tsuro is the quick-playing game in which directions can change as easily as the game plays. The rules are simple: You place your stones, select your tiles, and attempt to build a safe Path for your journey. The Paths of other players cross and connect, so the choices you make affect all the journeys across the board. Stay on the right Path-your journey begins here.</p>\r\n<p>The game consists of tiles with twisting lines on them, a 6x6 grid on which to lay these tiles and a token for each player. Each player has a hand of tiles. On your turn you do two things: place a tile from your hand onto the board next to your token and move your token as far as it can go along the line it is currently on, until it is stopped by an empty space with no tile in (yet), the edge of the board or colliding with another player's token. If your token reaches the edge of the board or collides with another player's token, you are out of the game. The aim of the game is to be the last player left with a token on the board. Strategy therefore consists of trying to drive your opponents either into each other or off the board whilst extending your own route in directions that will make it difficult for your opponents to do the same.</p>",

In an ef-fort to start a new village, the Forever King has selected 6 citizens for the task, each of whom has a unique set of skills they use to build their charter. In Charter stone, a competitive legacy game, players construct buildings and inhabit a shared village. Building stickers are removed from cards and permanently added to your charter on the board, becoming action spaces for any player to use. Thus, a few available buildings soon grow into a bustling village with dozens of actions. "

Us, Gravehold, and The Nameless - creatures seeking to snatch what little we left from our group. The breath is in our lungs,. The weak light in our eyes  For generations, we have taken refuge in an ancient and haunted place, one whose first purpose was forgotten for a thousand ages, until our exodus once again filled its empty halls and hovels iwth our shadows. Here in the darkness, we seek a way back to the light.  It has taken the breach mages an aeon to hone their dark craft, but they are ready, they are lethal. The breaches, the very conduits through which The Nameless travel, have become our weapon. The breach mages wield this power iwth undeniable ambition: to survive,to take back The World That Was, to protect our home.   Aeon's End  is a cooperative deck building game where your deck is never shuffled, a variable player order simulates the chaos of battle, and deck management makes all your decisions meaningful. Eveyry game you will face a different nemesis, each with a unique set of abilities requiring a different strategy to defeat. "

    "description": "<p>Ancient Egypt is overflowing with opportunity and as a royal advisor, you are tasked with enriching its society through art, religion, astronomy, writing, and agriculture. Gain the favor of the gods to build incredible monuments, advance your civilization, and collect piles of gold. Incur their wrath, however, and a disaster may upset your royal efforts. Battle for glory and push your luck in Ra, a game of high-stakes bidding and divine intervention.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Ra</strong> is an auction and set-collection game with an <a href=\"https://www.boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/Mythology#Egyptian\">Ancient Egyptian</a> theme. Each turn players are able to purchase lots of tiles with their bidding tiles (suns). Once a player has used up his or her suns, the other players continue until they do likewise, which may set up a situation with a single uncontested player bidding on tiles before the end of the round occurs. Tension builds because the round may end before all players have had a chance to win their three lots for the epoch. The various tiles either give immediate points, prevent negative points for not having certain types at the end of the round (epoch), or give points after the final round. The game lasts for three &quot;epochs&quot; (rounds).</p>",

    "description_preview": " Ancient Egypt is overflowing with opportunity and as a royal advisor, you are tasked with enriching its society through art, religion, astronomy, writing, and agriculture. Gain the favor of the gods to build incredible monuments, advance your civilization, and collect piles of gold. Incur their wrath, however, and a disaster may upset your royal efforts. Battle for glory and push your luck in Ra, a game of high-stakes bidding and divine intervention. \r\n  Ra  is an auction and set-collection game with an  Ancient Egyptian  theme. Each turn players are able to purchase lots of tiles with their bidding tiles (suns). Once a player has used up his or her suns, the other players continue until they do likewise, which may set up a situation with a single uncontested player bidding on tiles before the end of the round occurs. Tension builds because the round may end before all players have had a chance to win their three lots for the epoch. The various tiles either give immediate points, prevent negative points for not having certain types at the end of the round (epoch), or give points after the final round. The game lasts for three \"epochs\" (rounds). "

Now is the time for a clever leader to unite them into a powerful alliance, skillfully using the unique talents of each tribe to control the Kingdoms.</p>\r\nDo you have the wit and the wisdom to become the next Lord of <em>Ethnos</em> and usher in a Golden Age? Up to six players can evoke the assistance of the Tribes of <em>Ethnos</em> to earn themselves enough glory to be named the Lord of <em>Ethnos</em>. Find out if you're up to the task!<br /><br /><strong>The Tribes of <em>Ethnos</em></strong><br /><br />There are twelve distinct tribes that inhabit the land of <em>Ethnos</em>, and each has their own unique ability that will help you take control of the Kingdoms and gain glory for yourself. Call on the Centaurs when swift and decisive actions must be taken! Overwhelm your opponents with sheer numbers by relying on the Halflings! The Dwarves, Elves, Giants, Merfolk, Minotaurs, Orcs, Skeletons, Trolls, Wingfolk, and Wizards are all at your disposal!<br />Use the special abilities of each tribe to your advantage to take control of territories and gain yourself some extra glory along the way. Work with what you're given to spread your influence and unite the tribes of <em>Ethnos</em> to be crowned the victor!<br /><br /><strong>Beginning a New Age</strong><br />A game of <em>Ethnos</em> is divided into three Ages in which players will try to gain as much glory as possible. On their turn, players will choose to Recruit an Ally (from either the deck or the face up options on the table) or Play a Band of Allies. Recruiting allies to your cause is necessary if you want to gain any influence in the Six Kingdoms, which you do by playing Bands.<br /><br /><strong>Band Together<br /></strong> When you play a Band of Allies from your hand (from 1 to 10 cards), each ally within the band must belong to the same Tribe or the same Kingdom (color). Each band has a leader which will determine the ability you get to resolve when playing the band. If the band is large enough, you may place one of your control markers in that kingdom that matches the color of your leader card. You then use your leader card's ability. Then you must discard the cards remaining in your hand face up for other players to recruit from. These bands will be important for scoring at the end of the round, so leave them in front of you.<br /><br /><strong>Control the Kingdoms<br /></strong> As you gain more influence in a Kingdom, the bigger your bands must be to place your control markers there. Each Kingdom will reward players with an amount of glory at the end of an Age according to who has the most influence in each Kingdom. As Ages pass, the players with the second-most and third-most influence in each Kingdom will also gain glory.<br /><br /><strong> A New Age Dawns<br /></strong> The game will play out over three Ages, and the heralding of a new Age is brought on by the arrival of three dragons. Once the third dragon has been drawn from the deck, the Age ends and scoring for that Age begins. Control markers persist between Ages, representing the influence gained in Ages past. Once this has happened three times, the game is over and final scores can be tallied!</div>",

    "description": "<p>Preserved in its original form first published by Fantasy Flight Games in 2002, fans will find the same fantastic art from Jean-Louis Mourier and beloved gameplay that inspired the revised edition of the new and expanded Citadels. <br /><br />In Citadels Classic, the same inspired and simple gameplay remains, with players attempting to build a fantastical medieval city by constructing different districts. Each round, starting with whoever holds the crown, players will pass around a hand of characters equal to one plus the number of players, secretly choosing one character to employ, taking advantage of their special ability. Among the eight characters you might find, each boasts a different special ability: the Thief can steal all the gold from another player, the King grants gold for each Noble district you have constructed and receives the crown for the next round, and the Architect allows a player to build several districts that turn. <br /><br />After all players have chosen their character, they are revealed in the order determined by their rank, which is the number printed in the upper lefthand corner of their card. For example, if a player chose the Assassin with its rank of 1, they would resolve their turn first. The next to follow is the Thief with its rank of 2, then the Magician at 3, and so on, skipping characters that were not employed this round, and until all players have resolved their actions.<br /><br />When you do resolve your turn, you will choose to either take two gold coins from the bank or draw new district cards. Then, if you can afford to pay its cost, you may construct a single district from you hand. You may also resolve your character abilities as they apply during your turn, whether it be naming a character to kill with the Assassin or gaining extra gold with the Trader. Play continues until all players have resolved their actions, then the character cards are reshuffled and a new round begins.<br /><br />The first player to construct seven districts triggers the endgame, allowing the round to finish and all other players to take their final actions. Each district is worth its cost in victory points, with bonus points awarded for those who construct all seven of their districts and those who have at least one type of each district (noble, religious, trade, military, and unique). Whoever has the most victory points has built the most fabulous city and is crowned winner!</p>",

    "description_preview": " Preserved in its original form first published by Fantasy Flight Games in 2002, fans will find the same fantastic art from Jean-Louis Mourier and beloved gameplay that inspired the revised edition of the new and expanded Citadels.   In Citadels Classic, the same inspired and simple gameplay remains, with players attempting to build a fantastical medieval city by constructing different districts. Each round, starting with whoever holds the crown, players will pass around a hand of characters equal to one plus the number of players, secretly choosing one character to employ, taking advantage of their special ability. Among the eight characters you might find, each boasts a different special ability: the Thief can steal all the gold from another player, the King grants gold for each Noble district you have constructed and receives the crown for the next round, and the Architect allows a player to build several districts that turn.   After all players have chosen their character, they are revealed in the order determined by their rank, which is the number printed in the upper lefthand corner of their card. For example, if a player chose the Assassin with its rank of 1, they would resolve their turn first. The next to follow is the Thief with its rank of 2, then the Magician at 3, and so on, skipping characters that were not employed this round, and until all players have resolved their actions.  When you do resolve your turn, you will choose to either take two gold coins from the bank or draw new district cards. Then, if you can afford to pay its cost, you may construct a single district from you hand. You may also resolve your character abilities as they apply during your turn, whether it be naming a character to kill with the Assassin or gaining extra gold with the Trader. Play continues until all players have resolved their actions, then the character cards are reshuffled and a new round begins.  The first player to construct seven districts triggers the endgame, allowing the round to finish and all other players to take their final actions. Each district is worth its cost in victory points, with bonus points awarded for those who construct all seven of their districts and those who have at least one type of each district (noble, religious, trade, military, and unique). Whoever has the most victory points has built the most fabulous city and is crowned winner! "

Your only option if you're to resume your dungeon-delving activities is to sack the local mall of valuables and supplies.<br /><br />Magic Maze is a real-time, co-operative game. Each player can control any of the 4 Hero pawns whenever he wants in order to make that hero perform a very specific action, to which other players do not have access: move north, explore a new area, ride an escalator? all of this requires rigorous co-operation between the players in order to succeed at moving the heroes wisely, and complete your mission before the sand timer runs out.<br /><br />Moreover, you will only be allowed to communicate for short periods during the game. The rest of the time, you must play without giving any visual or audio cues to each other.</p>",

Your only option if you're to resume your dungeon-delving activities is to sack the local mall of valuables and supplies.  Magic Maze is a real-time, co-operative game. Each player can control any of the 4 Hero pawns whenever he wants in order to make that hero perform a very specific action, to which other players do not have access: move north, explore a new area, ride an escalator? all of this requires rigorous co-operation between the players in order to succeed at moving the heroes wisely, and complete your mission before the sand timer runs out.  Moreover, you will only be allowed to communicate for short periods during the game. The rest of the time, you must play without giving any visual or audio cues to each other. "

    "description": "<p>In <strong>El Grande</strong>, players take on the roles of Grandes in medieval Spain. The king's power is flagging, and these powerful lords are vying for control of the various regions. To that end, you draft caballeros (knights in the form of colored cubes) into your court and subsequently move them onto the board to help seize control of regions. After every third round, the regions are scored, and after the ninth round, the player with the most points is the winner.</p>\r\n<p>In each of the nine rounds, you select one of your 13 power cards to determine turn order as well as the number of caballeros you get to move from the provinces (general supply) into your court (personal supply).</p>\r\n<p>A turn then consists of selecting one of five action cards which allow variations to the rules and additional scoring opportunities in addition to determining how many caballeros to move from your court to one or more of the regions on the board (or into the castillo - a secretive tower). Normally, you may only place your caballeros into regions adjacent to the one containing the king pawn. The one hard and fast rule in El Grande is that nothing may move into or out of the king's region. One of the five action cards that is always available each round allows you to move the king to a new region. The other four action cards varying from round to round.</p>\r\n<p>The goal is to have a caballero majority in as many regions (and the castillo) as possible during a scoring round. Following the scoring of the castillo, you place any cubes you had stashed there into the region you had secretly indicated on your region dial. Each region is then scored individually according to a table printed in that region. Two-point bonuses are awarded for having sole majority in the region containing your Grande (large cube) and in the region containing the king.</p>",

    "description_preview": " In  El Grande , players take on the roles of Grandes in medieval Spain. The king's power is flagging, and these powerful lords are vying for control of the various regions. To that end, you draft caballeros (knights in the form of colored cubes) into your court and subsequently move them onto the board to help seize control of regions. After every third round, the regions are scored, and after the ninth round, the player with the most points is the winner. \r\n In each of the nine rounds, you select one of your 13 power cards to determine turn order as well as the number of caballeros you get to move from the provinces (general supply) into your court (personal supply). \r\n A turn then consists of selecting one of five action cards which allow variations to the rules and additional scoring opportunities in addition to determining how many caballeros to move from your court to one or more of the regions on the board (or into the castillo - a secretive tower). Normally, you may only place your caballeros into regions adjacent to the one containing the king pawn. The one hard and fast rule in El Grande is that nothing may move into or out of the king's region. One of the five action cards that is always available each round allows you to move the king to a new region. The other four action cards varying from round to round. \r\n The goal is to have a caballero majority in as many regions (and the castillo) as possible during a scoring round. Following the scoring of the castillo, you place any cubes you had stashed there into the region you had secretly indicated on your region dial. Each region is then scored individually according to a table printed in that region. Two-point bonuses are awarded for having sole majority in the region containing your Grande (large cube) and in the region containing the king. "

    "faq": "<h4>Frequently Asked Questions</h4>\r\n<p><strong>How do you play this game?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Nemesis is a relatively complex game. If you prefer learning how to play the game through a video rather than reading the rulebook, here's a comprehensive guide put together by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYIoVaU55eFUmwgztqvuF2w\">Board Game Replay</a>:</p>\r\n<div>\r\n<div class=\"d-block d-sm-none\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/g1NnAHptaeE\" width=\"300\" height=\"170\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></div>\r\n<div class=\"d-none d-sm-block\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/g1NnAHptaeE\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p><strong>Can you play this solo? Is it good?</strong></p>\r\n<p>The official rulebook includes a solo mode.

Each player takes the role of a restaurateur, attempting to curry the favor of the beloved geisha. Can you sequence your plays in thoughtful reflection to outmaneuver your opponent.? Find out in <em>Hanamikoji</em>!<br /><br /><strong>Play Your Cards Right</strong><br />Gameplay is focused around the geisha, and the use of cards representing instruments of entertainment to sway them to your establishment. Playing the majority of a color's cards in a round will draw the matching geisha to your restaurant. However, each of your offerings must be planned in advance, as you can only present the geisha with gifts based on what offering tiles you have available.</p>\r\n<p><br />At the start of a player's turn, they draw a card from the deck and decide which of the four offerings to perform. Each player begins the round with the same four offering tiles available, and each tile must be used exactly once during the round to play or discard cards in certain patterns.</p>\r\n<p><br />Once each player has performed all four of their actions, the Victory Markers on each Geisha are moved toward whoever curried the most favor with the Geisha that round. If the two players tied on how much favor they curried, then the Victory Marker stays put. If at the end of a round a player has earned the favor of four Geisha or Geisha whose points total 11 or more, then that player wins the game!</p>\r\n</div>",

    "description_preview": " \r\n  Win the favor of the Geisha!  Hanamikoji is a simple, yet deep game of careful consideration for two players. Each player takes the role of a restaurateur, attempting to curry the favor of the beloved geisha. Can you sequence your plays in thoughtful reflection to outmaneuver your opponent.? Find out in  Hanamikoji !   Play Your Cards Right  Gameplay is focused around the geisha, and the use of cards representing instruments of entertainment to sway them to your establishment. Playing the majority of a color's cards in a round will draw the matching geisha to your restaurant. However, each of your offerings must be planned in advance, as you can only present the geisha with gifts based on what offering tiles you have available. \r\n  At the start of a player's turn, they draw a card from the deck and decide which of the four offerings to perform. Each player begins the round with the same four offering tiles available, and each tile must be used exactly once during the round to play or discard cards in certain patterns. \r\n  Once each player has performed all four of their actions, the Victory Markers on each Geisha are moved toward whoever curried the most favor with the Geisha that round. If the two players tied on how much favor they curried, then the Victory Marker stays put. If at the end of a round a player has earned the favor of four Geisha or Geisha whose points total 11 or more, then that player wins the game! \r\n "

    "description": "<p>Walk a mile in the shoes of a spy! Or was it a kilometer in clogs?<br /><br />SPYFALL is an easy-to-learn card game of bluffing, probing questions, clever answers, and suspicion. At the start of each round, players receive a secret card letting them know where they are - a casino, space station, pirate ship, circus, (30 unique locations!) - except that one player receives the SPY card instead of the location. The Spy doesn't know where he is, but wins the round if he can figure it out before he blows his cover!<br /><br />Players then start asking each other questions during the intense 8-minute rounds. Non-Spy players want to ask questions and give answers that prove to the other players that they know where they are. But watch out! If your questions and answers are too specific, the Spy will easily guess the location and win, so you need to practice a bit of subtlety. But if your questions and answers are too generic, you might be accused of being the Spy. The Spy will also sometimes be asked questions (just like any other player would) and have to come up with questions of his own, without knowing anything about where he is! If you listened carefully to the other players, you'll be able to come up with a plausible question or answer... hopefully.<br /><br />Once per round, each player may accuse another player of being the Spy. If all players agree, the game ends and that player's secret card is flipped up. If the Spy is captured, each of the Non-Spy players win the round. If a Non-Spy is revealed, the Spy wins. Finally, if the Spy figures out where he is, he can reveal his card and make a guess. If he's right, he wins the round. If not, the Non-Spy players win.<br /><br />The game is played over a series of rounds and points are awarded each round. A complete game is typically five rounds and the cards are randomly dealt each round. You could even be the Spy two rounds in a row! After the last round, the player with the most points is the winner.</p>",

    "description_preview": " Walk a mile in the shoes of a spy! Or was it a kilometer in clogs?  SPYFALL is an easy-to-learn card game of bluffing, probing questions, clever answers, and suspicion. At the start of each round, players receive a secret card letting them know where they are - a casino, space station, pirate ship, circus, (30 unique locations!) - except that one player receives the SPY card instead of the location. The Spy doesn't know where he is, but wins the round if he can figure it out before he blows his cover!  Players then start asking each other questions during the intense 8-minute rounds. Non-Spy players want to ask questions and give answers that prove to the other players that they know where they are. But watch out! If your questions and answers are too specific, the Spy will easily guess the location and win, so you need to practice a bit of subtlety. But if your questions and answers are too generic, you might be accused of being the Spy. The Spy will also sometimes be asked questions (just like any other player would) and have to come up with questions of his own, without knowing anything about where he is! If you listened carefully to the other players, you'll be able to come up with a plausible question or answer... hopefully.  Once per round, each player may accuse another player of being the Spy. If all players agree, the game ends and that player's secret card is flipped up. If the Spy is captured, each of the Non-Spy players win the round. If a Non-Spy is revealed, the Spy wins. Finally, if the Spy figures out where he is, he can reveal his card and make a guess. If he's right, he wins the round. If not, the Non-Spy players win.  The game is played over a series of rounds and points are awarded each round. A complete game is typically five rounds and the cards are randomly dealt each round. You could even be the Spy two rounds in a row! After the last round, the player with the most points is the winner. "

Its innovative, easy-to-learn, cooperative gameplay has players working together against the monsters with varying levels of difficulty. Just as each monster is unique, they require different strategies and tactics to be defeated. "

    "description": "<p>Set in ancient Rome, Trajan is a development game in which players try to increase their influence and power in various areas of Roman life such as political influence, trading, military dominion and other important parts of Roman culture. In Trajan, a player has six possible actions: building, trading, taking tiles from the Forum, using the military, influencing the Senate, and placing Trajan tiles on his tableau. At the start of the game, each player has two differently colored pieces in each of the six sections (bowls) of his tableau. On a turn, the player picks up all the pieces in one bowl and distributes them one-by-one in bowls in a clockwise order. Wherever the final piece is placed, the player takes the action associated with that bowl. Acquire victory points (VPs) in whatever ways are available to you - and since this is a Feld design, you try to avoid being punished, too. At the Forum you try to anticipate the demands of the public. In the Senate you acquire influence which translates into votes on VP-related laws. With the military, you take control of regions in Europe, earning more points for those regions.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Your time at Horribilorum Sorcery Academy for Witty Witches and Wizards is coming to an end, and that means final exams are here! You and your fellow students must compete to brew the most difficult and valuable potions around in order to be crowned Student of the Year in Potion Explosion.<br /><br />In Potion Explosion players attempt to create potions by pulling colored marbles from a dispenser and matching them with the needed ingredients for the potions on the table in front of them. While basic turns are simple, clever players will strategically pull colored marbles that both fulfill a needed ingredient and cause matching colored marbles to stack up in a single column, allowing them to collect all the like colored marbles and save them for later turns.<br /><br />Potion Explosion's simple rules make it easy enough for the whole family to learn, but offers enough depth to keep puzzle game fans coming back for more.</p>",

    "description_preview": " Your time at Horribilorum Sorcery Academy for Witty Witches and Wizards is coming to an end, and that means final exams are here! You and your fellow students must compete to brew the most difficult and valuable potions around in order to be crowned Student of the Year in Potion Explosion.  In Potion Explosion players attempt to create potions by pulling colored marbles from a dispenser and matching them with the needed ingredients for the potions on the table in front of them. While basic turns are simple, clever players will strategically pull colored marbles that both fulfill a needed ingredient and cause matching colored marbles to stack up in a single column, allowing them to collect all the like colored marbles and save them for later turns.  Potion Explosion's simple rules make it easy enough for the whole family to learn, but offers enough depth to keep puzzle game fans coming back for more. "

    "description": "<p><em><strong>The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game</strong></em> is a cooperative adventure game in which the players attempt to complete a scenario, each with three heroes of their choice and a deck of allies, events and attachments to support them. Each round, players send their heroes and allies to quest or to fight with enemies that engage them. However, as the heroes and allies exhaust after questing, defending, or attacking, the players' options are typically insufficient to deal with everything at once. Therefore, players need to determine whether it is more urgent to quest and make progress in the scenario while the enemy forces gain power, or to take down enemies while making no progress, not knowing what will come next.</p>\r\n<p><em>The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game</em> is the base game of a Living Card Game for which new adventure packs are released monthly. The base game contains three scenarios, twelve famous characters from the works of J.R.R. Tolkien (including Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Denethor and Eowyn), and four pre-constructed player decks. Players can either use one of these decks or construct their own deck to increase their chances to be successful in the more challenging scenarios. The monthly adventure packs contain a new scenario, a new hero, and new player cards to be used in their deck. The base game is for 1-2 players, but with an additional base game the scenarios can be played with up to four players.</p>\r\n<p>Although this game is set in Tolkien's Middle Earth, the scenarios do not represent scenes from the books, but rather take place in the seventeen years from Bilbo's 111th birthday until Frodo's departure from the Shire.</p>\r\n<p>The scenarios from saga-expansions do represent scenes from the books. Saga-expansions will form the Campaign Mode so that you can play all the saga quests that deal with the trilogy (+ Hobbit) together in one marathon campaign.</p>",

    "description_preview": "   The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game   is a cooperative adventure game in which the players attempt to complete a scenario, each with three heroes of their choice and a deck of allies, events and attachments to support them. Each round, players send their heroes and allies to quest or to fight with enemies that engage them. However, as the heroes and allies exhaust after questing, defending, or attacking, the players' options are typically insufficient to deal with everything at once. Therefore, players need to determine whether it is more urgent to quest and make progress in the scenario while the enemy forces gain power, or to take down enemies while making no progress, not knowing what will come next. \r\n  The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game  is the base game of a Living Card Game for which new adventure packs are released monthly. The base game contains three scenarios, twelve famous characters from the works of J.R.R. Tolkien (including Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Denethor and Eowyn), and four pre-constructed player decks. Players can either use one of these decks or construct their own deck to increase their chances to be successful in the more challenging scenarios. The monthly adventure packs contain a new scenario, a new hero, and new player cards to be used in their deck. The base game is for 1-2 players, but with an additional base game the scenarios can be played with up to four players. \r\n Although this game is set in Tolkien's Middle Earth, the scenarios do not represent scenes from the books, but rather take place in the seventeen years from Bilbo's 111th birthday until Frodo's departure from the Shire. \r\n The scenarios from saga-expansions do represent scenes from the books. Saga-expansions will form the Campaign Mode so that you can play all the saga quests that deal with the trilogy (+ Hobbit) together in one marathon campaign. "

    "description": "<p>Go down in the dungeon. Kill everything you meet.<br /><br />Backstab your friends and steal their stuff. Grab the treasure and run.<br /><br />Admit it. You love it.<br /><br /><strong>Munchkin</strong> is the mega-hit card game about dungeon adventure . . . with none of that roleplaying stuff. You and your friends compete to kill monsters and grab magic items. And what magic items! Don the Horny Helmet and the Boots of Butt-Kicking. Wield the Staff of Napalm . . . or maybe the Chainsaw of Bloody Dismemberment. Start by slaughtering the Potted Plant and the Drooling Slime, and work your way up to the Plutonium Dragon . . .<br /><br />And it's illustrated by John Kovalic!<br /><br />Fast-playing and silly, Munchkin can reduce any roleplaying group to hysteria. And, while they're laughing, you can steal their stuff.</p>\r\n<p>The Deluxe Edition has a big gameboard to keep your cards in place, and twelve player standies with plastic stands that you move on the gameboard as you level up!</p>",

Munchkin  is the mega-hit card game about dungeon adventure . . . with none of that roleplaying stuff. You and your friends compete to kill monsters and grab magic items. And what magic items! Don the Horny Helmet and the Boots of Butt-Kicking. Wield the Staff of Napalm . . . or maybe the Chainsaw of Bloody Dismemberment. Start by slaughtering the Potted Plant and the Drooling Slime, and work your way up to the Plutonium Dragon . . .  And it's illustrated by John Kovalic!  Fast-playing and silly, Munchkin can reduce any roleplaying group to hysteria. And, while they're laughing, you can steal their stuff. \r\n The Deluxe Edition has a big gameboard to keep your cards in place, and twelve player standies with plastic stands that you move on the gameboard as you level up!

    "description": "<p>How else could the honorable Henry Morgan celebrate his 30 years of governing <strong>Jamaica</strong> than with a race around the island? Gathering every Pirate and Buccaneer around, the &quot;Great Challenge&quot; will be a memorable race. Not to mention - what's better than a race where you can earn some booty and shoot at your opponents?<br /><br />The goal is to sail around the island of <strong>Jamaica</strong> as fast as possible, while gathering the goods required: gold for port taxes, powder for naval battles and food to eat while out on the high seas. Each time the pirates meet, they will have to fight to try and steal the contents of each other's holds (and maybe pawn off a chest full of cursed gold at the same time). May the fastest and richest win!</p>",

Gathering every Pirate and Buccaneer around, the \"Great Challenge\" will be a memorable race. Not to mention - what's better than a race where you can earn some booty and shoot at your opponents?  The goal is to sail around the island of  Jamaica  as fast as possible, while gathering the goods required: gold for port taxes, powder for naval battles and food to eat while out on the high seas. Each time the pirates meet, they will have to fight to try and steal the contents of each other's holds (and maybe pawn off a chest full of cursed gold at the same time). May the fastest and richest win! "

    "description": "<p>71 Years Ago: The plague came out of nowhere and ravaged the world. Fever, cough, sores, and death - once infected, most died within a week. Nothing could stop it. The world did its best. It wasn't good enough.</p>\r\n<p>The last fragments of our people have desperately kept the world from collapsing completely. For three generations we have lived on the seas, on floating stations they called &quot;havens.&quot; Far from the plague, we are able to provide supplies to the mainland - antibiotics, food, medicine, and tools - to keep them (and us) from succumbing completely. We keep a network of the largest known cities in the world alive. Things have been tough the past few years. Cities far away from the havens have fallen off the grid. We don't know what's happened to them. We don't know why the supplies aren't reaching them. We have only a few cities left on our gird. We are failing.</p>\r\n<p>A cooperative legacy game for two to four players, <strong>Pandemic Legacy: Season 2</strong> immerses players in a harrowing tale of survival. It is seventy-one years after the events of Pandemic Legacy: Season 1, and humanity has been brought to its knees. A network of the last known cities persists, supplied by the havens, isolated stations floating in the ocean far from the plague. Three generations of survivors have called the havens home. Most of them have never set foot on the mainland. But now supplies are running low and the people have turned to you to lead. It's up to you to save what remaining cities you can and stop the world from ending for good.</p>",

    "description_preview": " 71 Years Ago: The plague came out of nowhere and ravaged the world. Fever, cough, sores, and death - once infected, most died within a week. Nothing could stop it. The world did its best. It wasn't good enough. \r\n The last fragments of our people have desperately kept the world from collapsing completely. For three generations we have lived on the seas, on floating stations they called \"havens.\" Far from the plague, we are able to provide supplies to the mainland - antibiotics, food, medicine, and tools - to keep them (and us) from succumbing completely. We keep a network of the largest known cities in the world alive. Things have been tough the past few years. Cities far away from the havens have fallen off the grid. We don't know what's happened to them. We don't know why the supplies aren't reaching them. We have only a few cities left on our gird. We are failing. \r\n A cooperative legacy game for two to four players,  Pandemic Legacy: Season 2  immerses players in a harrowing tale of survival. It is seventy-one years after the events of Pandemic Legacy: Season 1, and humanity has been brought to its knees. A network of the last known cities persists, supplied by the havens, isolated stations floating in the ocean far from the plague. Three generations of survivors have called the havens home. Most of them have never set foot on the mainland. But now supplies are running low and the people have turned to you to lead. It's up to you to save what remaining cities you can and stop the world from ending for good. "

    "description": "<p>The excitement in the air is electric as the leaders round the last corner and head for the finish line. Each team has used cunning and skill to position their sprinter for this moment, but only one has done enough to pull off the win!<br /><br />Will your team lead from the front and risk exhaustion? Should you play it safe in the middle of the pack? Could you surprise everyone by striking from the back? Can you time your move perfectly?<br /><br />Anyone can race, few become champions!<br /><br />Flamme Rouge is a fast-paced, tactical bicycle racing game where each player controls a team of two riders: a Rouleur and a Sprinteur. The players' goal is to be the first to cross the finish line with one of their riders. Players move their riders forward by drawing and playing cards from that riders specific deck, depleting it as they go. Use slipstreams to avoid exhaustion and position your team for a well timed sprint for the win.</p>",

    "description_preview": " The excitement in the air is electric as the leaders round the last corner and head for the finish line. Each team has used cunning and skill to position their sprinter for this moment, but only one has done enough to pull off the win!  Will your team lead from the front and risk exhaustion? Should you play it safe in the middle of the pack? Could you surprise everyone by striking from the back? Can you time your move perfectly?  Anyone can race, few become champions!  Flamme Rouge is a fast-paced, tactical bicycle racing game where each player controls a team of two riders: a Rouleur and a Sprinteur. The players' goal is to be the first to cross the finish line with one of their riders. Players move their riders forward by drawing and playing cards from that riders specific deck, depleting it as they go. Use slipstreams to avoid exhaustion and position your team for a well timed sprint for the win. "

Gameplay is for 1 - 4 players and typically lasts for 45 - 90 minutes. To play, you must make your way past the alarms and guards, find the stash and get to the roof to escape. But be careful - if anyone on your crew gets caught, it's all over.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Game Contents</strong>&lt; /br&gt; - 124 Premium Square Cards, 48 Cardboard Tiles&lt; /br&gt; - 9 Character Meeples, 3 Guard Meeples&lt; /br&gt; - 9 Translucent Dice&lt; /br&gt; - 73 Tokens&lt; /br&gt; - 24 Wood Walls&lt; /br&gt; - Colored Instructions&lt; /br&gt;&lt; /br&gt; <strong>Product Reviews</strong></p>\r\n<p>&quot;Finally, a heist movie that fits on your tabletop!&quot; - <strong>Raph Koster</strong></p>\r\n<p>&quot;Burgle Bros is an intense co-op game with great replay value. It's very thematic, easy to learn and moves quick. You'll love how the tension ramps up as the game progresses.&quot; - <strong>Reza Lackey</strong></p>\r\n<p>&quot;Don't let the kiddie title fool you, Burgle Bros is an intensely strategic game filled with fun, highly thematic moments. Have you ever wanted to pull off a huge heist? This is the closest you'll get without breaking the law.&quot; - <strong>Peter Sciretta</strong></p>\r\n<p>&quot;It's a light-ish co-op where you feel your world closing in, and like there's NO WAY you can get out unseen by the guards. Great tension, and I'm guessing great relief if you can get out in time. I wouldn't know, since the guards spotted us. But NEXT TIME...!&quot; - <strong>Rich Sommer</strong></p>\r\n<p>&quot;I enjoyed the game and it felt like my decisions mattered. I like the way the game makes you do real co-op, having to coordinate your actions nearly all of the time. You definitely can't just daydream during other player's turns.&quot; - <strong>Darron Shaffer</strong></p>",

    "description_preview": "  Overview  \r\n Burgle Bros is a cooperative boardgame where you assemble a crew, make a plan, and pull off the impossible heist! Gameplay is for 1 - 4 players and typically lasts for 45 - 90 minutes. To play, you must make your way past the alarms and guards, find the stash and get to the roof to escape. But be careful - if anyone on your crew gets caught, it's all over. \r\n  Game Contents < /br> - 124 Premium Square Cards, 48 Cardboard Tiles< /br> - 9 Character Meeples, 3 Guard Meeples< /br> - 9 Translucent Dice< /br> - 73 Tokens< /br> - 24 Wood Walls< /br> - Colored Instructions< /br>< /br>  Product Reviews  \r\n \"Finally, a heist movie that fits on your tabletop!\" -  Raph Koster  \r\n \"Burgle Bros is an intense co-op game with great replay value. It's very thematic, easy to learn and moves quick. You'll love how the tension ramps up as the game progresses.\" -  Reza Lackey  \r\n \"Don't let the kiddie title fool you, Burgle Bros is an intensely strategic game filled with fun, highly thematic moments. Have you ever wanted to pull off a huge heist? This is the closest you'll get without breaking the law.\" -  Peter Sciretta  \r\n \"It's a light-ish co-op where you feel your world closing in, and like there's NO WAY you can get out unseen by the guards. Great tension, and I'm guessing great relief if you can get out in time. I wouldn't know, since the guards spotted us. But NEXT TIME...!\" -  Rich Sommer  \r\n \"I enjoyed the game and it felt like my decisions mattered. I like the way the game makes you do real co-op, having to coordinate your actions nearly all of the time. You definitely can't just daydream during other player's turns.\" -  Darron Shaffer  "

    "description": "<p>Your pulse races as diamond fever rises. No wonder: the adventurers delve into the cave, which is sparkling with diamonds, and try to bring our as many jewels as possible. But uncanny dangers and malicious researchers play an evil game in the cave. Now you must flee or risk everything in order to win with the largest treasure.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Diamant</strong> (also published as <strong>Incan Gold</strong>) is a quick, fun game of bluff and daring in which explorers push their luck while exploring in search of gold and treasure. In each round, you decide whether to delve deeper into the temple, adding to your riches, or escape with the share you've acquired so far. Every time an explorer braves new territory, more gems and dangers appear. Giant spiders, mummies and fire can cause you to lose everything. Is it worth the risk? You decide. But if you leave, those who remain in the temple may acquire a bigger share of each stash of jewels yet to be found.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Incan Gold:</strong></p>\r\n<p>You and your fellow adventurers explore the ruins of an ancient Incan temple, looking for turquoise, obsidian, and gold. At every turn, you must decide whether to play it safe by returning to camp with the treasure you've gathered so far; or to be a truly intrepid adventurer and keep on exploring.</p>\r\n<p>Going farther into the ruins means risking your treasure by falling victim to giant spiders, wandering mummies, fire spouts, and venomous snakes! But priceless Incan artifacts are rumored to exist here...and you can be the one to discover them if you conquer your fears and forge ahead!</p>",

    "description_preview": " Your pulse races as diamond fever rises. No wonder: the adventurers delve into the cave, which is sparkling with diamonds, and try to bring our as many jewels as possible. But uncanny dangers and malicious researchers play an evil game in the cave. Now you must flee or risk everything in order to win with the largest treasure. \r\n  Diamant  (also published as  Incan Gold ) is a quick, fun game of bluff and daring in which explorers push their luck while exploring in search of gold and treasure. In each round, you decide whether to delve deeper into the temple, adding to your riches, or escape with the share you've acquired so far. Every time an explorer braves new territory, more gems and dangers appear. Giant spiders, mummies and fire can cause you to lose everything. Is it worth the risk? You decide. But if you leave, those who remain in the temple may acquire a bigger share of each stash of jewels yet to be found. \r\n  Incan Gold:  \r\n You and your fellow adventurers explore the ruins of an ancient Incan temple, looking for turquoise, obsidian, and gold. At every turn, you must decide whether to play it safe by returning to camp with the treasure you've gathered so far; or to be a truly intrepid adventurer and keep on exploring. \r\n Going farther into the ruins means risking your treasure by falling victim to giant spiders, wandering mummies, fire spouts, and venomous snakes! But priceless Incan artifacts are rumored to exist here...and you can be the one to discover them if you conquer your fears and forge ahead! "

    "description": "<p>Lisboa is a game about the reconstruction of the great Portuguese capital city after a series of terrible catastrophes. On November 1, 1755, Lisboa suffered an earthquake of an estimated magnitude of 8.5-9.0, followed by a devastating tsunami and 3 days of raging fires. The city was almost totally destroyed.<br /><br />Lisboa is thus played, in part, on a representational map of the city. During the planning of the downtown re-building project, the type of businesses permitted in each street was pre-determined. The clockmakers and goldsmiths had their street; as did the bookstores and libraries; the tailors and silk vendors; and the toolmakers as well. This all comes into play on the Lisboa gameboard. <br /><br />Players represent the nobility of Lisboa who will use their influence in the reconstruction and business development of the new city. <br /><br />In rebuilding the city, players will make use of the Royal Builder, who works with the architects to build Lisboa anew, while the Marquis will provide aid in the development of commerce. The King will provide players with political help in re-opening the beautiful new city. But the true reason you are rebuilding the city is not for greatness, or even fame or fortune. As a nobleman or noblewoman of Lisboa, your primary motivation is the acquisition of Wigs--a most important trading commodity of the Era, and the means of scoring points in the game.</p>",

    "description_preview": " Lisboa is a game about the reconstruction of the great Portuguese capital city after a series of terrible catastrophes. On November 1, 1755, Lisboa suffered an earthquake of an estimated magnitude of 8.5-9.0, followed by a devastating tsunami and 3 days of raging fires. The city was almost totally destroyed.  Lisboa is thus played, in part, on a representational map of the city. During the planning of the downtown re-building project, the type of businesses permitted in each street was pre-determined. The clockmakers and goldsmiths had their street; as did the bookstores and libraries; the tailors and silk vendors; and the toolmakers as well. This all comes into play on the Lisboa gameboard.   Players represent the nobility of Lisboa who will use their influence in the reconstruction and business development of the new city.   In rebuilding the city, players will make use of the Royal Builder, who works with the architects to build Lisboa anew, while the Marquis will provide aid in the development of commerce. The King will provide players with political help in re-opening the beautiful new city. But the true reason you are rebuilding the city is not for greatness, or even fame or fortune. As a nobleman or noblewoman of Lisboa, your primary motivation is the acquisition of Wigs--a most important trading commodity of the Era, and the means of scoring points in the game. "

Can you match his ruthless determination to build the most revered monuments?<br /><br />To do this, you will need to transport stone blocks on ships from your quarry to different construction sites. But you alone do not choose where the ships go. Your opponents have monumental plans of their own and want to prevent your success. A fierce competition for the precious stone resources plays out. Only with the right strategy and a little luck can you succeed.<br /><br />In Imhotep, the players take on the roles of ancient Egyptian architects. Over six rounds, they try to transport their stone blocks to end up in the most valuable positions at five construction sites: pyramid, obelisk, chamber tomb, temple, and market. But a player can only choose one of three actions in a turn: excavate a new stone block from the quarry, load a block onto a ship, or move a ship to a construction site. From there, the massive stone blocks must be unloaded in order from bow to stern and placed on the sites in preset sequences. Depending on where the blocks end up, players earn different point values either immediately or at the end of the game.<br /><br />In each turn, you must weigh your options for getting your own stones into place and thwarting your opponents' placement plans. You must get your blocks to the right places, in the right order, at the right time to be the greatest architect.</p>",

There’s just one rule: each piece you play must touch at least one other piece of the same color, but only at the corners! The goal is to fit the most pieces on the board. The game ends when no more pieces can be placed down, and the player with the lowest number remaining wins!</p>",

It takes less than a minute to learn, but offers endless strategy and fun challenges for the whole family. Each player gets a set of 21 pieces – in red, blue, green, or yellow – then takes turns placing them on the board. There’s just one rule: each piece you play must touch at least one other piece of the same color, but only at the corners! The goal is to fit the most pieces on the board. The game ends when no more pieces can be placed down, and the player with the lowest number remaining wins! "

Victory requires respect for all the Gods - players cannot afford to sacrifice to only one God, but must pay homage to each of five Gods in turn. Each turn, the players bid for the favors of the Gods, as only one player can have the favor of each God per turn - and each player is also limited to the favor of a single God per turn.  -Ares allows the movement of player armies and the building of Fortresses. -Poseidon allows players to move their navies and build Ports. -Zeus allows his followers to hire priests and build temples. -Athena provides her worshipers with philosophers and universities. -Apollo increases the income of his worshippers.

After all, that's what students are for.<br /><br />Welcome to the world of Alchemists! Perform experiments to discover the magical properties of your ingredients. Demonstrate your knowledge by selling potions. Use the money to buy artifacts that further your research. Publish, publish, publish! Earn grants. And expose the fallacies published by those fools who think they can be your rivals.<br /><br />Alchemists is a game of strategy, risk assessment, and deduction. Do you experiment to get more knowledge or do you publish now to get more points? Pay to endorse the latest theory of toads or save your money for an artifact? And should you really be selling that potion to the large axe-wielding barbarian when you aren't quite sure of its effects? The choices you make will prove whether you are the world's greatest alchemist.<br /><br />This game is designed to be played using an app that turns your tablet or smartphone into an ingredient card reader. The app is available for free. Supported operating systems are: iOS, Android, Windows. If, for whatever reason, you don't want to use the mobile app, you can still use the web-based version or play with one player acting as the game master.</p>",

    "description_preview": " A little mandrake root, a little raven's feather. Toss them in the cauldron and see what they make. Should you drink it? Maybe not. After all, that's what students are for.  Welcome to the world of Alchemists! Perform experiments to discover the magical properties of your ingredients. Demonstrate your knowledge by selling potions. Use the money to buy artifacts that further your research. Publish, publish, publish! Earn grants. And expose the fallacies published by those fools who think they can be your rivals.  Alchemists is a game of strategy, risk assessment, and deduction. Do you experiment to get more knowledge or do you publish now to get more points? Pay to endorse the latest theory of toads or save your money for an artifact? And should you really be selling that potion to the large axe-wielding barbarian when you aren't quite sure of its effects? The choices you make will prove whether you are the world's greatest alchemist.  This game is designed to be played using an app that turns your tablet or smartphone into an ingredient card reader. The app is available for free. Supported operating systems are: iOS, Android, Windows. If, for whatever reason, you don't want to use the mobile app, you can still use the web-based version or play with one player acting as the game master. "

    "description": "<p>While empires rise and fall in Eastern Europa, the rest of the world takes notice. Two distant factions, Albion and Togawa, send emissaries to scout the land and employ their own distinct styles of conquering.<br /><br />This expansion to Scythe adds 2 new factions, each with 5 miniatures, 31 custom wooden tokens, and 1 faction mat. It also includes new cardboard tokens, 2 new player mats, 6 Automa cards, and a custom plastic insert designed to fit into the expansion box or the original Scythe box. The expansion works seamlessly with any version of Scythe.<br /><br />The originally game was capped at 5 players, but with 2 new player mats in the expansion 6-7 player games can be played. To scale up, the expansion includes alternate abilities for some of the original factions.</p>",

Two distant factions, Albion and Togawa, send emissaries to scout the land and employ their own distinct styles of conquering.  This expansion to Scythe adds 2 new factions, each with 5 miniatures, 31 custom wooden tokens, and 1 faction mat. It also includes new cardboard tokens, 2 new player mats, 6 Automa cards, and a custom plastic insert designed to fit into the expansion box or the original Scythe box. The expansion works seamlessly with any version of Scythe.  The originally game was capped at 5 players, but with 2 new player mats in the expansion 6-7 player games can be played. To scale up, the expansion includes alternate abilities for some of the original factions. "

    "description": "<p><strong>Third edition:</strong></p>\r\n<p>The most notorious vampire of all rises again in the third edition of Fury of Dracula, a board game of deduction and gothic horror based on Bram Stoker's classic novel. One player takes control of the legendary Count Dracula as he stealthily crosses Victorian-era Europe, spreading his diabolical vampirism everywhere he goes. Up to four other players govern Mina Harker and her determined companions as they try to locate and destroy the fiendish Count before he plunges Europe into horrific darkness. But in this heated game of cat and mouse, the hunted prey may also be preying on his hunters. Any day's travel might bring the hunters to Dracula's location. On any night the Count may attack.</p>\r\n<p>This edition features all-new art and graphic design crafted to complement the game's intuitive, thematic mechanics. Rounds are now broken into day and night: hunters take actions during both, but Dracula can only act at night. Combat is now more streamlined and decisive, and new rumor tokens allow Dracula to mislead hunters and extend the terrible reach of his influence. Count Dracula triumphs if he advances his influence track to thirteen; if the hunters can defeat him before then, they save the continent of Europe and win the game.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Fourth edition:</strong></p>\r\n<p>The fourth edition of <em>Fury of Dracula</em> contains pre-painted miniatures instead of unpainted figures.</p>",

    "description_preview": "  Third edition:  \r\n The most notorious vampire of all rises again in the third edition of Fury of Dracula, a board game of deduction and gothic horror based on Bram Stoker's classic novel. One player takes control of the legendary Count Dracula as he stealthily crosses Victorian-era Europe, spreading his diabolical vampirism everywhere he goes. Up to four other players govern Mina Harker and her determined companions as they try to locate and destroy the fiendish Count before he plunges Europe into horrific darkness. But in this heated game of cat and mouse, the hunted prey may also be preying on his hunters. Any day's travel might bring the hunters to Dracula's location. On any night the Count may attack. \r\n This edition features all-new art and graphic design crafted to complement the game's intuitive, thematic mechanics. Rounds are now broken into day and night: hunters take actions during both, but Dracula can only act at night. Combat is now more streamlined and decisive, and new rumor tokens allow Dracula to mislead hunters and extend the terrible reach of his influence. Count Dracula triumphs if he advances his influence track to thirteen; if the hunters can defeat him before then, they save the continent of Europe and win the game. \r\n  Fourth edition:  \r\n The fourth edition of  Fury of Dracula  contains pre-painted miniatures instead of unpainted figures.

    "description": "<p>A mad scientist holds the world hostage with his terrifying inventions. An alien warlord from a far away galaxy brings his limitless army of bizarre minions to conquer the planet. A giant rampaging robot cuts a swath of destruction across the coast, destroying major population centers. And who will stand in their way? A team of heroes, all with impressive powers and abilities stand between the world and the forces of evil. Will you help them? Answer the call to protect the multiverse.</p>\r\n<p>Sentinels of the Multiverse is a cooperative, fixed-deck card game with a comic book flavor. Each player plays as one of ten heroes, against one of four villains and the battle takes place in one of four different dynamic environments.</p>\r\n<p>The Sentinels of the Multiverse: Enhanced Edition features a much larger box than our original print run, with enough space to hold 578 cards and still have room for all the cards from both the Rook City and Infernal Relics expansions. The Enhanced Edition also features 36 divider cards, one for each hero, villain and environment from the core game, both expansions and even promo characters. The 120 round tokens and 42 rectangular tokens are useful for tracking hero and villain HP, as well as conditional modifiers that can occur throughout the game. The game also includes a 20 page rulebook, complete with instructions, diagrams, a quick-start guide and even bios of the heroes and villains.</p>",

A giant rampaging robot cuts a swath of destruction across the coast, destroying major population centers. And who will stand in their way? A team of heroes, all with impressive powers and abilities stand between the world and the forces of evil. Will you help them? Answer the call to protect the multiverse. \r\n Sentinels of the Multiverse is a cooperative, fixed-deck card game with a comic book flavor. Each player plays as one of ten heroes, against one of four villains and the battle takes place in one of four different dynamic environments. \r\n The Sentinels of the Multiverse: Enhanced Edition features a much larger box than our original print run, with enough space to hold 578 cards and still have room for all the cards from both the Rook City and Infernal Relics expansions. The Enhanced Edition also features 36 divider cards, one for each hero, villain and environment from the core game, both expansions and even promo characters. The 120 round tokens and 42 rectangular tokens are useful for tracking hero and villain HP, as well as conditional modifiers that can occur throughout the game. The game also includes a 20 page rulebook, complete with instructions, diagrams, a quick-start guide and even bios of the heroes and villains. "

    "description_preview": "   Maracaibo  , the new strategy game for 1-4 players by Alexander Pfister, is set in the Caribbean during the 17th century. The players try to increase their influence in three nations in four rounds with a play time of 40 minutes per player. \r\n The players sail on a round course through the Caribbean. E.g., you have city tiles where you are able to perform various actions or deliver goods to. One special feature is an implemented quest mode over more and various tiles, which tells the player, who chase after it, a little story. \r\n As a player, you move with your ship around the course, managing it by using cards like in other games from Alexander Pfister.
